10.1109/GCE.2014.17,FACE-IT: A Science Gateway for Food Security Research,Gateway Computing Environments Workshop,2014,Conference Paper,"Understanding the potential impacts of climate change and the likely effectiveness of adaptation strategies is of crucial importance to the sustainability of both agriculture and natural ecosystems. Improvements in data availability and simulation model fidelity promises to enable significant improvements in knowledge. However, progress is hindered by the challenges inherent in creating and managing increasingly complex data acquisition, processing, simulation, post-processing, and intercomparison pipelines. To address these challenges, we are developing the Framework to Advance Climate, Economic, and Impact Investigations with Information Technology (FACE-IT) for crop and climate impact assessments. This integrated geospatial data processing, delivery, and simulation framework enables data ingest from diverse geospatial data archives; data regridding, aggregation, and other relevant processing required prior to simulation; large-scale climate impact simulation using a range of applications, including different agricultural models, and leveraging high-performance and cloud computing; and post-processing to produce aggregated yields and other output variables needed to enable model intercomparison and to connect biophysical model outputs to global and regional economic models and assessments. It leverages the capabilities of the Globus Galaxies platform to enable the capture of both workflows and simulation outputs in well-defined, reusable, and easily comparable forms. We describe FACE-IT and its application to studies within the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project.","Biological system modeling, computational modeling, Logic gates, Biomass, Supply chains, optimization, Data visualization",1,0,0,1
10.1145/2016741.2016787,A European Framework to Build Science Gateways: Architecture and Use Cases,TeraGrid Conference,2011,Conference Paper,"Science Gateways are playing an important role in scientific research performed using e-Infrastructures and their relevance will further increase with the development of more sophisticated user interfaces and easier access mechanism. Through the highly collaborative environment of a Science Gateway, users spread around the world and belonging to various Virtual Research Communities can easily cooperate to reach common goals and exploit all the resources of the cyber-infrastructure they are entitled to use.One of the major tasks of a Science Gateway is to supervise the user access to the available services, denying the use to those people who are not authorised. This activity has to comply with the role of users inside the VRC.Users operating in a Science Gateway can belong to different organisations having their own security policies and the Virtual Research Community has to comply with them. As a result, the security chain inside the Science Gateway has to allow each organisation to keep the control of their users hiding, at the same time, the complexity of the security mechanisms underneath the portal.In this work we present a general framework to build Science Gateways [1][2] and the customisations made to meet the requirements of a couple of use cases coming from different scientific communities: those of the European Union funded DECIDE (www.eu-decide.eu) and INDICATE (www.indicate-project.eu) projects.The goal of DECIDE project is to design, implement, and validate a Science Gateway for the computer-aided extraction of diagnostic markers from medical images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease and other forms of dementia. Using the same platform neurologists, physicians and scientists can store their images and data on grid and perform analysis and comparisons with a huge set of reference cases available on grid. The INDICATE project aims instead at demonstrating, with real-life examples, the advantages of the adoption of e-Infrastructures in the digital cultural heritage domain. The plugin developed enables INDICATE Science Gateway, and its digital cultural heritage community, to access two different e-Infrastructure repositories in an easy way with a friendly user interface but keeping the digital resources safe and the transactions private.The framework defined to support the above use cases is an extension of Liferay portal framework, which provides a whole set of web 2.0 tools and services for the development of generic portals. These have been integrated with a more flexible security workflow and a new set of portlets to access the Grid services. The final architecture of a Science Gateway consists of two part: a front-end building the graphical user interface, and a back-end providing the access to the grid services implemented.A major extension to Liferay is the security system. The new developed security system merges three different security mechanisms in a single workflow allowing users to access Grid resources based on the credentials provided by the organisations they belong to. The idea behind was to combine Shibboleth2 identities in the front-end with X.509 proxies generated by robot certificates in the back-end. The former enables the federation of organisations having different authentication policies while the latter allows users to access Grid resources, without needing any personal certificates whose request and management procedure is very often judged quite cumbersome by non-experts. The ""glue"" between the two layers is an LDAP server running in the back-end that implements a mechanism to map authorised users on Grid resources. Services managing user and grid credentials are not integrated in Liferay Portal but run in different hosts, in order to increase the reliability and security of the Science Gateway.Once the user is authenticated, the portlets developed provide the functionalities to manage the Grid credentials in order to access the e-Infrastructure behind. The portlet-based interface to Grid is built on the OGF-standard SAGA Java API and it is not bound to any particular middleware.Besides the interaction with the computational services of an e-Infrastructure, the proposed framework includes the possibility to easily build and manage data repositories interacting with the gLibrary framework [3] and to encrypt/decrypt sensible data with the Secure Storage System [4].","grid portal, e-collaboration, Liferay, grid computing, e-science, science gateways",1,0,0,1

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2978089,Research on Multimodal Perceptual Navigational Virtual and Real Fusion Intelligent Experiment Equipment and Algorithm,IEEE Access,2020,Article,"Virtual experiment is an important field of human-computer interaction. With more and more virtual laboratories emerging, we found that problems regarding virtual experiments are rising. Such problems can be listed as follows: First, human-computer interaction has lower efficiency during the process of virtual experiment, which means the computer cannot understand the user's intention thus leading to incorrect operation. Second, there are less detections for false behavior during experiments. Third, the virtual laboratory's sense of operation and realism is not strong. In order to solve the above problems, the multimodal sensing navigation virtual and real fusion laboratory (MSNVRFL) was designed and implemented in this paper. We design a new set of experimental equipment with the function of cognition and study a multimodal fusion model and algorithm for chemical experiments, which are both finally verified and applied in MSNVRFL. By using multimodal fusion perception algorithm, the user's true intentions can be understood and the human-computer interaction efficiency can be improved. By carrying out a virtual experiment with the mold of virtual and real fusion, problems like resources wasting and dangers happened during experiment can be avoided, user's sense of operation and realism can be improved. In addition, teaching navigation and wrong operation behavior reminders are provided for users. The experimental result shows that our method can improve the efficiency of human-computer interaction, reduce the user's cognitive load, strengthen the user's sense of reality and operation and stimulate students' interest in learning. © 2013 IEEE.","human-computer interaction, intelligent teaching, Multimodal fusion, virtual experiments",0,1,0,1
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025229,A Design of Smart Beaker Structure and Interaction Paradigm Based on Multimodal Fusion Understanding,IEEE Access,2020,Article,"Virtual chemistry experiment is an important teaching tool in middle schools. It can not only help students understand the experimental principles, but also help them memorize the experimental procedures. However, there are still some problems in virtual chemistry experiments. First, in existing research, user intentions are often misunderstood and cannot be accurately understood. Second, the existing research fail to identify the user's wrong actions, which reduce the accuracy of the experiment. Third, the user sense of operation and realism is not strong during the experiment, which reduces the user's experience. Finally, the lack of navigation guidance for experimental operations increases user learning time. In order to solve these problems. This paper proposes a scheme for establishing an intelligent navigational chemical laboratory based on multimodal fusion. First of all, we design a new smart beaker structure with perceptual ability, which can be used to complete most chemical experiments and give users a real sense of experience. Besides, we propose a multimodal fusion understanding algorithm, which reduces the misidentification of the experiment and better understands the real intention of the user. Finally, intelligent navigation and wrong behavior recognition functions are added to the experimental equipment, which improves the efficiency of human-computer interaction. The results show that Compared with the existing virtual laboratory or system, the chemical laboratory scheme proposed in this paper through multimodal fusion understanding algorithm greatly reduces the user's memory load and improves the success rate of the experiment. Moreover, through the combination of virtual and real, the virtual chemistry experiment not only improves the authenticity of the operation, but also stimulates the students' interest in learning, which is well received by users. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Remote and virtual laboratories can be a solution to improve this design in distance methodology. This fact has been more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences with respect to education. Its transparent integration into the learning process and the inclusion of learning analytic features are essential features of these kinds of technologies. Without them, lecturers cannot track the performance and the satisfaction of their students. Our LoT@UNED (Laboratory-of-Things@UNED) platform has been implemented to include all these educational features for IoT environments, ranging from edge to cloud computing. Taking the advantages of the IoT paradigm, this platform involves acquiring practical competences within IoT and edge-cloud programming topics, among others. Furthermore, its flexibility allows us to host other areas, such as cybersecurity. Specifically, our platform incorporates a set of sustainable capabilities (scalability, availability, and security), so contributing to the SDG 4 challenge with a low-complex and efficient solution for quality distance education. To analyze the impact of our proposed solution, this work also focuses on studying the influence among several acceptance UTAUT/TAM factors during the students’ learning and teaching process. To achieve this goal, both exploratory and confirmatory analyses have been conducted. The reliability and validity of data are also analyzed. An improved structural equation model has also been studied, satisfying several statistical indicators according to the recommended thresholds in the current literature.

10.1109/AERO.2017.7943855,NSF GENI cloud enabled architecture for distributed scientific computing,IEEE Aerospace Conference,2017,Conference Paper,"GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded program which provides a virtual laboratory for networking and distributed systems research and education. It is well suited for exploring networks at a scale, thereby promoting innovations in network science, security, services and applications. GENI allows researchers obtain compute resources from locations around the United States, connect compute resources using 100G Internet2 L2 service, install custom software or even custom operating systems on these compute resources, control how network switches in their experiment handle traffic flows, and run their own L3 and above protocols. GENI architecture incorporates cloud federation. With the federation, cloud resources can be federated and/or community of clouds can be formed. The heart of federation is user identity and an ability to ""advertise"" cloud resources into community including compute, storage, and networking. GENI administrators can carve out what resources are available to the community and hence a portion of GENI resources are reserved for internal consumption. GENI architecture also provides ""stitching"" of compute and storage resources researchers request. This provides L2 network domain over Internet2's 100G network. And researchers can run their Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers on the provisioned L2 network domain for a complete control of networking traffic. This capability is useful for large science data transfer (bypassing security devices for high throughput). Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), a research institute in the state of North Carolina, has developed ORCA (Open Resource Control Architecture), a GENI control framework. ORCA is a distributed resource orchestration system to serve science experiments. ORCA provides compute resources as virtual machines and as well as baremetals. ORCA based GENI rack was designed to serve both High Throughput Computing (HTC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) type of computes.

10.1109/CarpathianCC.2017.7970464,Adaptive access to robotic learning experiences in a remote laboratory setting,International Carpathian Control Conference,2017,Conference Paper,"We describe the architecture of a small remote laboratory made available by means of a web-based adaptive system (Mindlab2). The system supports hands-on e-learning experiences with robotics and automation, performed via internet. It allows the learners to access and solve 'problems', submit their solutions and have them evaluated. The problems are defined by the teacher, also specifying instructional aspects, such as the learner's skills involved in producing a solution. For each individual learner a personal Student Model is maintained, recording learner's knowledge and skills, as shown by the solved problems. The access to the problem is guarded by the system, ensuring that the problems can all be 'seen' by any student, whereas a learner can work on a problem only if its prerequisites are covered, or anyway 'not too far' from her current competences. The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptivity, e-learning, Robot Control, Teleoperation, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The purpose of a virtual laboratory is to support collaborative work of all the people who are involved in any stage of the experimental process. Problem Solving Environment (PSE) is an approach and a technology that is used for the definition and composition of complex applications, hiding programming and configuration details to the user that can concentrate instead only on the specific biological problem. PSE allows building virtual laboratories specialized for a specific domain, such as bioinformatics. At the University of Salento, we have developed ProGenGrid (Proteomics and Genomics Grid), a system which aims to provide a virtual laboratory where e-scientists can simulate biological experiments, composing existing analysis and visualization tools, monitoring their execution, storing the intermediate and final output and finally, if needed, saving the model of the experiment for updating or reproducing it at a later time. Different bioinformatics services and workflows have been deployed in the LIBI (International Laboratory of BioInformatics) project, aiming at setting up an advanced bioinformatics and computational biology laboratory, focusing on basic and applied research in modern biology and biotechnologies. In this paper we present recent developments in the ProGenGrid system, with a special focus on the possibility to configure a computational grid by using the workflow editor.

With respect to the teaching laboratory of real robot, it is insufficient to meet the requirements of students for the limited resources in the laboratories and their opening times. What's more, there are some unknown potential risks in real robot labs which are not conducive to students' normal use. However, some flexible solutions have been developed to permit an effective teaching in the labs of robotics and automation systems. One of these solutions is the virtual laboratory based Web, which is an effective tool to provide the requirements help for hands-on experiment.

The proposed virtual lab covers required knowledge of the robot kinematics and dynamics utilizing MATLAB as programming language. In addition, all projects of the virtual laboratory platform can be further developed besides some designed experimental projects, which means the users can do research based on the virtual laboratory same as the real laboratory. Furthermore, multi-functions of virtual laboratory platform from different perspectives are illustrated in this paper. The virtual laboratory platform has been applied in the department of automation in Beihang university for practical teaching of undergraduates. The results show two advantages of the virtual lab.

First, the gateway middleware must manage multiple types of credentials associated with different resource providers. Second, the separation of the user interface and middleware layers means that security credentials must be securely delegated from the user interface to the middleware. Third, the same middleware may serve multiple gateways, so the middleware must correctly isolate user credentials associated with different gateways.

Both types of learning resources can easily be shared between universities or industrial partners, leading to dramatic reductions in the costs associated with development, construction, operation and maintenance of traditional laboratory set-ups; however, each is characterised by inherent advantages and disadvantages. We compare and contrast remote experiments and virtual labs, using two case studies: 'Cambridge Weblab', a remote experiment built by the Computational Modeling (CoMo) Group at the University of Cambridge and 'SRM web-suite', a virtual lab developed by CMCL innovations. The Cambridge Weblab remote experiment uses a Siemens SIMATIC PS7 industrial interface to control a chemical reactor, yielding authentic experiences of industrial practices for students. A variety of pedagogical approaches employed by institutions using the Weblab are also discussed in this paper. The SRM web-suite uses an advanced engine design tool that simulates fuels, combustion and emissions in conventional and advanced internal combustion engines. The detailed simulations have been precisely tailored for training and educational settings. The web-suite labs provide students and engineering professionals with experience using the latest industry-standard technology, whilst supporting a wide range of educational goals e.g. undergraduate courses in combustion engines or chemical reaction engineering and advanced courses in futuristic fuels or powertrain engineering.

There is a fast growing demand for professionals with cloud computing skills. However, the demand is not being fulfilled, partially due to the inability of educational institutions to keep up with technological advancements, as well as a lack of hands-on educational material. We have been developing portable virtual lab modules which can be used to teach basic cloud computing concepts and skills early and often. The labs run on virtual machines and can be ported between different courses and between different platforms. The virtual labs can be deployed in centralized or decentralized ways.

Therefore, curricula of Biomedical Engineering (BME) courses include cardiac electrophysiology. This paper describes a virtual laboratory designed for the study of the generation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) based on cellular electrophysiology. In detail, the virtual lab includes (1) an equivalent source model for cardiac cells, (2) a formulation of the mathematical relationship between the transmembrane potential and the transmembrane current, (3) the determination of resulting extracellular potentials, and (4) the calculation of the ECG by a weighted summation of transmembrane currents. Since these tasks require specific presumption and knowledge concerning cardiac geometry, a geometrical model was constructed using anatomical stylized segments of the left ventricle. Propagation parameters control the activation sequence as well as velocity and direction for anisotropic conduction. In order to verify the developed models and algorithms simulation results were compared against experimentally obtained data under various physiological conditions. Although there is considerable scatter in the measurements, the comparison indicates that a definite relationship exists between measured and computed waveforms. Simulations interactively show physiological and pathophysiological changes in the ECGs for various user setting of the cell function. In conclusion, the interactive laboratory enables the user to study the relationship between the electric activity of cardiac cells and the resulting extracellular potentials including the ECGs on the body surface.

In the first virtual lab, every experiment instrument in real lab is visualized as a Java component. In the other kind of virtual lab, the algorithm students learn in the course is packed as a Web Service component by C, C++ or Java. In both platforms, those components are listed in the system. Students is able to select Java components or Web Service components as the experiment they want to do need and integrate them by building connections between them.

Also, the classes held in didactic laboratories enhance the learning ability of the students, because they help the understanding of the subject matter. There are also reports stating that students feel more motivated to learn Chemistry when they make use of practical and dynamic classes. However, the availability of laboratories to carry out practical activities is difficult to found in different levels of education in several countries. This paper assumes that the expansion of resources to increase the experimental practice of Chemistry can be achieved by developing virtual laboratories in a way of helping them to get involved in active learning. In this work a virtual laboratory, called VirtuaLabQ, with predefined experiments about Chemical Transformations is introduced. Also, a case study that shows the use of VirtuaLabQ integrated to hands-on laboratory is presented. The case study was performed with Engineering undergraduate students that attend the Chemical Transformation course. The main target of this study was to investigate if practicing the experiments previously in VirtuaLabQ improves the students' performance in experiments accomplished in a hands-on chemistry laboratory. Two sets of laboratory experiments were conducted, in wich students first performed online activities in VirtuaLabQ and after in the hands-on laboratory, during regular class time. Also, students answered questionnaires evaluating the performance of each experiment in virtual and hands-on laboratory. Four questions were chosen to be analyzed in order to check the main target of this work. Results indicate that the integration of virtual and hands-on experiments in a Chemistry undergraduate course assists in the good performance of students in a hands-on laboratory and can contribute to the improvement of student learning.

Teaching engineering classes online during the pandemic has shown us the values of in-person interaction and the versatility of information that can be conveyed in physical classrooms. Many types of teaching strategies, such as physical demonstrations and in-class activities, are more accessible in-person compared to virtual sessions. To address this issue, we introduce two virtual lab modules with (a) pre-recorded and (b) real-time models that provide platforms for virtual mechanical tensile testing and a remote photon quantum entanglement experiment, respectively. The first virtual lab platform was built from a host of recorded mechanical tests on several engineering materials samples. After choosing the experiment/material, students can simultaneously view the data acquisition and the video of the test in detail. The numerical raw data set for each specimen is accessible after completion of each experiment in form of a spreadsheet. The introduction of the virtual lab has allowed us to add interactive elements to solid mechanics and machine design classes. For the second virtual laboratory module, we present a real time lab platform, where the participating students can perform experiments and collect data in real time by accessing the lab setup remotely. The general concept of the real time virtual lab is based on a human-in-the-loop control system that allows a user to operate an actuator remotely. To feature this real-time approach to virtual laboratory, we selected photon quantum entanglement experiments as part of mechatronics class. The early results, drawn from the students' feedback, demonstrate the promising outcomes of the virtual lab platforms for students learning and instructor-student interaction. Participating students expressed high level of connection to the classes and conceptual grasp of the course topics.

Science gateways have proven to be an effective way of bringing HPC resources to a much larger user base. However, developing a new gateway demands substantial effort, requiring both cyberinfrastructure and domain expertise. This paper describes an approach by core software developers to provide domain specific web services (DomWS) to science gateway and application developers. The core developers deliver a set of web services that understand domain specific semantics and translate domain application requests into computational and other tasks that are dispatched onto the distributed high end resources. This approach allows gateway and application developers to easily create customized application services and focus on the gateway functions and interfaces, such as gadgets and desktop clients, that serve their user community. The DomWS approach is not a generic solution for all simulation services. Our aim is to help application developers apply this framework with ease to their specific models and simulations with a small degree of code modification. DomWS also provides reusable modules and templates for common tasks needed by the targeted user community.

Until recently the ability to infer evolutionary relationships was limited by the amount of DNA sequence data available, but new DNA sequencing technologies have largely removed this limitation. As a result, DNA sequence data are readily available or obtainable for a wide spectrum of organisms, thus creating an unprecedented opportunity to explore evolutionary relationships broadly and deeply across the Tree of Life. Unfortunately, the algorithms used to infer evolutionary relationships are NP-hard, so the dramatic increase in available DNA sequence data has created a commensurate increase in the need for access to powerful computational resources. Local laptop or desktop machines are no longer viable for analysis of the larger data sets available today, and progress in the field relies upon access to large, scalable high-performance computing resources. This paper describes development of the CIPRES Science Gateway, a web portal designed to provide researchers with transparent access to the fastest available community codes for inference of phylogenetic relationships, and implementation of these codes on scalable computational resources. Meeting the needs of the community has included developing infrastructure to provide access, working with the community to improve existing community codes, developing infrastructure to insure the portal is scalable to the entire systematics community, and adopting strategies that make the project sustainable by the community.

Visual exploration and discovery can be invaluable tools providing prompt and intuitive insights into the intrinsic data characteristics, enabling scientists to rapidly identify interesting areas within which to apply computationally expensive algorithms or to discover correlations in data patterns. The paper outlines a new approach for creating a user-friendly, integrated and cross-platform framework to facilitate big data access, visualization and exploration, thus empowering astrophysicists to focus on pitching new ideas for scientific advances. We present a flexible distributed architecture striking a balance between local interactive exploration tools and remote services responsible for hiding data complexity.

They are interfaced with science gateway technologies in order to allow collaborative activity between users and to provide customization and scalability of data analysis/processing workflows hiding underlying technicalities. Local tools enable interactive visualization optimized for ubiquitous computing environments, intuitively controlling the resulting visualisation. The motivations behind such a framework are envisaged to meet the requirements of the exploitation of the Gaia mission outcomes and are shown in the paper by a number of case studies.

IT specialists support with the efficient access to HPC infrastructures. They design, implement and configure the simulations and models reflecting the sophisticated theoretical models and approaches developed and applied by domain researchers. Roles in such interdisciplinary teams may overlap dependent on the knowledge and experience with computational resources and/or the research domain. Bioinformaticians, for example, are in general trained to act as IT specialists, while having also a good knowledge about biology and chemistry to support the user community competently. Domain researchers are mainly not IT specialists and the requirement to employ HPC infrastructures via command line often forms a huge hurdle for them. Thus, there is the need to increase the usability of simulations and models on HPC infrastructures for the uptake by the user community. Science gateways form a solution, which offer a graphical user interface tailored to a specific research domain with a single point of entry for job and data management hiding the underlying infrastructure. In the last 10 years quite a few web development frameworks, science gateway frameworks and APIs with different foci and strengths have evolved to support the developers of science gateways in implementing an intuitive solution for a target research domain. The selection of a suitable technology for a specific use case is essential and helps reducing the effort in implementing the science gateway by re-using existing software or frameworks. Thus, a solution for a user community can be provided more efficiently.

Specifically, we discuss the use of science gateways to access Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), a US regulatory standard that covers a broad range of US federal government-owned or regulated data, and that also provides a useful proxy for other types of sensitive data, such as private sector intellectual property. We focus on the impact of CUI requirements on science gateway platforms that can be used to create and manage science gateway instances. Gateway platforms are centrally operated by gateway platform providers who create and control gateway instances on behalf of gateway providers. Broadly, platforms operate following either a multi-tenant or else a multi-instance pattern. Multi-tenanted science gateway platforms are designed to support multiple science gateways simultaneously, with each gateway as a tenant to a single operational instance of the platform middleware. Multi-instance platforms, on the other hand, provide and manage an entire instance of the science gateway software for each gateway. This paper reviews these two scenarios from the perspective of the Science Gateways Platform as a service (SciGaP), a multitenanted gateway platform based on the open-source Apache Airavata software. We examine requirements for providing multitenanted platforms for CUI gateways and also the requirements for providing the same software as a multi-instance platform. In both cases, we assume the use of CUI-compatible resources from commercial cloud providers. Both approaches are technically feasible but have trade-offs that must be considered. © 2020 IEEE.","cloud computing, Controlled Unclassified Information, cyberinfrastructures, cybersecurity, distributed systems, protected data, science gateways",1,0,0,1

For example, design code asked designers/students to make distribution of re-bars for several numbers rather than one re-bar in the designed beam. Students can estimate the total amount of reinforcement cross sectional area by simple calculation, but students have to distribute the total amount area of re-bars to several numbers of re-bars with small diameter. In this requirement of the code, the students who learn RC structure design at the beginning stage are not easy to understand from theoretical point of view. However, they can easily learn, if they have hands on experience like real experiments or numerical simulations. Here, the real experiments for RC structures are required a lot of time and cost. Therefore, if a realistic simulation tool, so-called 'Virtual RC Structure Lab', is provided for engineering educational purpose, students could have a chance to learn from virtual hands on experience for RC structure design. © 2015 IEEE.","failure behavior, hands on experience learning, RC structures, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

One of these new opportunities is the possibility to access and use computers and equipment remotely. This paradigm can be used for many different purposes-from education and research to management and business tasks. With the increased need for remote access technologies, the establishment of remote access networks is also on the rise. Such networks provide the possibility to establish remote and virtual laboratories, which can be accessed from the Internet. The goal of the virtual laboratories is to provide users with software that simulates and emulates real networks, devices and equipment. This type of laboratories enables the students to practice their skills before using real equipment. Remote laboratories, on the other hand, provide a virtual interface to a real devices. The remote access laboratories are providing the students with a realistic view of the system behavior and are allowing them access to professional tools from anywhere and whenever they need. With the help of the remote laboratories, institutions without access to professional equipment, can run experiments and access specific tools from any location. In this paper we will investigate the process of establishing and using one such remote access laboratory- A laboratory for wireless networks and technologies. The lab setup consists of a remotely accessed computer, a wireless spectrum analyzer and a signal generator. This set of devices provides possibilities for analysis of various modulation techniques, as well as other specific characteristics of the wireless communication systems and devices. In order to extend the functionality of the laboratory set of wireless routers and a group of wireless sensor nodes is added. The wireless routers would provide the possibility to study one of the most widely used family of communication standards-the IEEE 802.11. The wireless sensor networks are currently also very attractive as a research area and are becoming even more widely used. The set of wireless sensor devices will further increase the capabilities of the laboratory and will provide the possibility for remote experimenting with their communication and data routing protocols. © 2014 IEEE.","remote access laboratories, signal generator, spectrum analyzer, Wi-Fi routers, wireless sensor networks",0,1,0,1

Learning in a 3D environment allows greater interaction with contents in a unique way as students perceive it as being really there. Simulations are being designed, a combination of real-world environment with the information supplied by devices, where measurements can be replicated and data analyzed. This study presents a virtual scenario of a Measurements and Instrumentation laboratory.Electrical Engineering courses aim to train students to succeed in meeting the challenges within competitive and everchanging professional contexts. In order to prepare undergraduate students for ongoing success, the courses must provide effective training in the application and development of practices, typically implemented in large projects and organizations. Developing high quality engineering course units is definitely a challenging task. Courses can be provided remotely, but careful planning is required to design quality course units because problems may occur in meeting quality targets. The developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), including multimedia and internet-based education platforms, facilitate the creation of reliable solutions to these challenges. Studies show that a smart application of multimedia technologies and webbased education platforms can provide great results towards better quality of engineering courses. Many challenges on how to suitably approach the educational process have already been put forward. Higher Education institutions use multiple approaches to teaching and learning, combining a range of methods, including e-learning, videoconferencing, face-to-face teaching and hard-copy resources in course delivery. The authors present a software model for engineering, which is based mainly on the Wirefusion<sup>®</sup> software, and a virtualreality platform called VEMA. The project intends to improve the quality of teaching and learning in higher education through effective application of information technologies and the sciences of learning. 3D virtual learning environments arise as solutions to the extent that, in addition to offering features associated with communication and information sharing, they promote flexible learning spaces and moments. At the level of higher education, and in accordance with the paradigm of Bologna, virtual environments acquire special importance to allow learning beyond the classroom time and space.","Three-dimensional displays, Solid modeling, Electronic learning, Rendering (computer graphics), computational modeling, Internet, e-learning, interactive application, software packages, training and education, virtual reality prototype, 3D lab internet",0,1,0,1

SDN as a technology provides a high level of abstraction by decoupling the control plane from the data plane giving the ability to network administrators and operators to 'program' the network in much the same way as ordinary computer programmers write their programs in high level language such as Python, PHP, C++, C# and other. All of the network programming is carried out onto a centralized computer called a SDN controller, which connects to the data plane (hardware devices) via open standard protocols such as OpenFlow. The ever growing user demands regarding the networks and its underlying structure plays a key role in the adoption of SDN technology. Even though SDN is in its early days of development it has undergone a lot of changes during the past few years. This leads us to believe that this technology is going to be implemented into real world networks in the near future.

The exposure to limitless information and experiences has completely modified their view of the world in ways unfamiliar to other generations. Therefore educators must adapt the content and teaching/lecturing methods according to their expectations. One way of enhancing the learning experience is to be aware of the current attitudes and behaviors of today's students and to rely more and more on the technological improvements in educational strategies. Goal oriented and intellectually inquisitive students prefer experimental activities, which are structured, involve teamwork and virtual collaboration instead of simple narrations and monologues. In addition, students are sometimes involved in part time or even full time jobs that significantly reduce their time of preparation for educational activities. The paper presents an innovative cloud computing approach and its implementation within HyperTraining, a collaborative learning framework for career development and internship programmes.

Although trusted digital repositories are not mainstream application in the domain of science gateways and the social sciences are not the usual domain for a science gateway we argue in this paper that DRI has many of the principal characteristics of a science gateway and that the domain of social science will benefit in the future from the same advantages that other more numerical-based disciplines reap from science gateways. In addition to offering tools to ingest vast amounts of heterogeneous data sets, a trusted digital repository must offer specific functionalities regarding persistence and trustworthiness of the stored data sets. Trusted digital repositories must maintain the information for a long period and this entails precise and at times difficult choices in the architecture and implementation details. Another facet in which DRI (and most TDRs) differ from mainstream science gateways is the relationship between data and metadata, in many science gateways, metadata is created from the automated analysis of data sets, while in DRI much of the metadata is manually defined by specialised users. Furthermore, as the data sets are heterogeneous in nature, the metadata used for their description is of crucial importance. In this paper we argue that TDRs such as DRI, will play an increasingly important role in the future of the social science community and that they constitute the modern equivalent of the great libraries of the past, places in which knowledge was kept and preserved to be available to researchers of the present and the future. Furthermore, although DRI is far from being the only Trusted Digital Repository available, we argue that certaing design decision such as the support of multiple metadata standards and its modular nature, make it an interesting example of a flexible TDR. © 2015 IEEE.","Digital Repository of Ireland, Distributed Storage, Social Sciences, Trusted Digital Repository",1,0,0,1

This requires a good understanding of the underlying DCIs. Science Gateways (SGs) provide the users with an environment that eases the interaction with the DCIs. As a previous step, IT skilled users should populate the SGs with friendly but advanced tools (e.g. Workflows, visualization tools) that not only support the scientists to build their own experiments but also adapt them in an optimal way to the infrastructures. In Astronomy, the Virtual Observatory provides the community with services and tools for data access and sharing. However, state of the art telescopes and the coming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), able to reach data rates in the exa-scale domain, will also require advanced tools for data analysis and visualization that should be run on DCIs as well as shared on SGs. In the here presented work, we have selected as exemplar a set of analysis tasks of interest for some SKA use cases. These analysis tasks have been implemented as web services that use the COMPSs programming model in order to achieve a more efficient use of the DCIs. At the same time, the nature of the web services turns them into blocks that the astronomers can combine with VO services to build their own workflows. The web services and the workflows built upon them form a two-level workflow system that hides the technical details of the DCIs and exploits them efficiently. This approach is used for the first time in analytical tasks of interest for the SKA that benefits from the capabilities of the DCIs. © 2015 IEEE.","Astronomy, distributed computing infrastructures, science gateways, virtual observatory, web services, workflows",1,0,0,1

High costs associated with equipment, space, and maintenance staff, impose certain constraints on resources for traditional laboratories. While, Virtual and Remote Laboratories can overcome these limitations, they present important limitations in their use. Some actions are repetitive in nature, cannot be executed trivially or in reasonable time by a user. Some others might be simply impossible without computer help. For example, doing a linear regression of values obtained in an experiment, performing a comparison of results obtained by making a sweep in the values of a particular variable or taking a system to an initial state. Hence, it arises the need of encoding some experimental tasks to automatize their execution. With other existing applications, to encode experiments, users need to know how VRLs are implemented. In addition, they have to manage the language in which the simulation was created so they need to handle fluently a simulation language just to perform experiments. The authors propose a tool called the Experiment Editor, to undertake automated experiments for VRLs. The Experiment Editor enables the user to encode experiments regardless of the language in which the laboratory was implemented. To do so, it provides a powerful and easy-to-learn language, and the corresponding interpreter that supports the execution of the experiments. © 2016 IEEE.","Easy Java(script) Simulations, experimentation language, experiments, remote laboratories, simulations, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

To provide affordable virtual laboratories to these engineering colleges, Government of India runs the Virtual Labs project with a select set of participating institutions to create virtual labs required for entire engineering student population of India. The program suffers from two problems: 1) lack of focus on pedagogy and learnability of labs being created, and 2) little ability to scale to more teachers and subject matter experts to produce labs aligned to local contexts. This paper presents a model (LEAD model) for the design of virtual labs for a data structures and algorithms course in computer science and is intended to address the problems stated above. The model encodes the principles of learning in the design and structure of an experiment so that labs can be learnable by design. The model is based on constructivist theory of learning. It uses Bloom's Taxonomy for defining learning objectives and applies Merrill's first principles and Gagne's 9 events of instruction as instructional design methodologies. To ensure tasks in an experiment indeed aid learning, the model requires a mapping between tasks and learning principles to be created and published along with the experiment. The model uses a pedagogy that lays strong emphasis on conceptual understanding without the use of code or program. To demonstrate the efficacy of this model, we present the data analysis of the feedback from early users of one the experiments.

To design a photovoltaic system in any location it is essential to know the exact amount of solar resource available in the area. For this purpose, collecting data on solar radiation becomes crucial. Currently, there exist databases where we can find information on solar radiation but only for horizontal surfaces (known as global solar irradiance on horizontal surfaces). After this, by applying really complex mathematical equations and algorithms, it is possible to obtain solar radiation data for non-horizontal surfaces.

This paper introduces the implementation of a microgrid virtual laboratory for a design course. The key elements of this developed course are described in detail and the reflections from the students are investigated. This contribution also provides a statistical analysis of the students' knowledge gap in the field of microgrids.

Usually, the studies of such systems are limited to simulations owing to the hardships in setting up the hardware. Virtual laboratories have shown immense impact in filling this gap of infrastructure availability by using technologies to simulate and/or remotely connect to real equipment for educational purposes. This work describes the design and implementation of a remote triggered wind turbine dynamometer experiment that will allow students to operate the instrumentation remotely to study the effect of load variations in turbines with different blade configurations at different wind speeds. The impact of blade configurations and wind speeds on load variations in turbines are key learning outcomes designed within the experiments associated to the dynamometer. Data representing torque, power and efficiency characteristics of a wind turbine are detailed in this work. Specific advantages of this design include multi-variable characterization without having to change the physical design by forecasting the running conditions for different blade parameters and tuning the load. © 2017 IEEE.","dynamometers, NACA 0012, remote-triggered, SD7062, wind turbine",0,1,0,1

This paper proposes a new concept in virtual and remote laboratories: the augmented remote laboratory (ARL). ARL is being tested in the first and second years of the new degrees in industrial engineering and computer engineering, respectively, at the School of Engineering, University of Huelva, Huelva, Spain. By means of augmented reality techniques, ARL allows the student to experience sensations and explore learning experiences that, in some cases, may exceed those offered by traditional laboratory classes. The effectiveness of this methodology for remote laboratory work is evaluated by comparing it to practical sessions in the laboratory at the university itself with the same group of students. Students completed a questionnaire after having experienced both types of practicals, and the results show that the use of ARL improves student outcomes.

The numerical method used is the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method that has been successfully applied in many engineering fields. Using this numerical method, the irradiance distribution can be successfully evaluated in different planes far from the simulation grid without degrading performance. In addition, an easy-to-use MATLAB GUI handles all the parameters of the FDTD simulation and computes theoretical values of irradiance for both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regions.

The application, organized as a set of tools developed using Easy Java Simulations, enables the study of the kinematics of parallel robotics. A set of classical parallel structures was implemented such that LABEL can solve the inverse and direct kinematic problem of 5R, 3RRR, and Delta robots. An intuitive graphical user interface lets the student change the joint coordinates or Cartesian coordinates of the end effector while observing a graphical representation of the robot. In addition, a set of five practical sessions based upon this tool was developed. During the practical sessions, the student analyzes the inverse kinematics of parallel structures and the direct kinematic problem. Moreover, LABEL makes it easy to analyze the singularities that appear in the solution of the inverse and direct kinematic problem. These singularities are analyzed through the use of a path planning application, which allows the user to plan a trajectory in the robot's workspace. This helps the student to analyze the position and velocity of the end effector while observing the joint trajectories and speeds of the actuators.

10.1109/UPEC.2013.6715005,Electrical engineering teaching and distance learning using a desktop virtual reality system,Universities Power Engineering Conference,2013,Conference Paper,"Higher education has evolved in the last decade with the use of information technology. This change was called distance education, a teaching method in which the student does not need to meet with the teacher on a certain day and time. The student may be either at home or at work and may have no interaction with the other parts, either the teacher or other students. It has allowed the institutions to resolve geographical gaps in order to reach the largest number of students. On the other hand, it paved the way for the 'non-traditional' universities oriented for 'adult work', in a narrow range of graduation programs, compatible with the current demands from industry. It is also important to mention that distance education is becoming increasingly appropriate for non-academic studies, such as corporate training environments. This paper addresses Circuit Theory systems, more specifically laboratory practices geared towards teaching and learning. The choice was made from observing the needs in the specific context of a measures and instrumentation laboratory, mainly related with access to the means and equipment to carry out laboratory practice. The purpose of the work is the use of virtual experimentation to carry out laboratory practice and also as an alternative tool to meet the needs of access to the means and equipment of the laboratory. In the present case, the basis of the project was the construction of a 3D lab environment (Measures and Instrumentation) where the equipment and the components can be seen and manipulated. The project involves simple electrical schematics, which later can be changed in values, presenting new results, and displays a set of menus and submenus to support experiments. The virtual laboratory can accommodate new devices and scenarios, being adapted to new subjects, such as electric machines and power system analysis of the Electrical Engineering program. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop VR prototype, 'Virtual Electric Manual' - VEMA, can be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment. Several interactive scenes were developed to illustrate the idea using a measurements and instrumentation laboratory as virtual environment. The added value of these various features in the educational context is that they contribute to the construction of new virtual environments, able to benefit the communication between teachers and students and among themselves, thus creating new opportunities for each student to participate more actively in his/her own learning construction process. Rather than being seen as mere information files, these e-learning platforms should be perceived as a means to promote interaction and experimentation through technological resources. © 2013 IEEE.","electrical engineering, Teaching and Distance Learning, Virtual Reality System",0,1,0,1

The learning of the basic concepts of circuit theory, the type of concepts and the form of experimentation, traditionally acquired in educational laboratories, are fundamental and demand new and better tools.

As users interact with and explore data in a visual analytics environment they are each developing their own unique analytic process. The goal of ALIDA is to observe and record the human-computer interactions and utilize these observations as a means of supporting user exploration; ALIDA does this by using interaction to make decision about user interest. As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view. Current work has tested ALIDA under the exploration of homonyms for users wishing to explore word linkages within a dictionary. Ongoing work includes using ALIDA to guide users in transfer function design for volume rendering within scientific gateways. ©2010 IEEE.","artificial intelligence, Cognition, Intent discernment, Volume rendering",1,0,0,1

To improve activities of M&S, we need to develop collaborative technologies. In this context, we develop the application software Virtual Laboratory Environment (VLE) to model, simulate and analyze dynamic systems. VLE is based on the Discrete Event System specification (DEVS) formalism, a widely recognized specification for modeling and simulating discrete events systems. The main features of the DEVS formalism are a modular and hierarchical approach of the M&S and a relative simplicity to develop the simulation algorithms. Researchers and engineers from different comunities used VLE to develop and study models. However, the modelers need to share source code in order to reuse, couple and combine models. It is not sufficient because they are not helped for maintenance and version upgrades issues.

In order to design a controller for a physical system, one has to know the operational behaviors of that system very well so that a proper controller could be designed. Keeping this in mind, educational computer-aided software with a user-friendly visual interface was developed. The software provides an opportunity for students to simulate physical systems without and with the controllers they designed. Since it was developed to accompany undergraduate control system courses, the main purpose of this software was to create an interactive, practical, visual, and functional environment for the students who taking ACS courses. Therefore, it was called as virtual control laboratory (VCL). Basically, the students were able to design and simulate classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Besides, any other type of compensator with a transfer function or a state space model can be also combined with the physical system model for simulation and analysis. A laboratory type scope with two input channels was embedded in VCL in order to visually see and analyze the simulation results in the time domain. Responses from the students taking ACS course were also given to evaluate the proposed educational software from students' point of view. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","control engineering education, interactive educational tool, system simulation, virtual control lab",0,1,0,1

The high cost of laboratory equipment deprives many educational institutions of delivering quality education. Virtual laboratories can alleviate this problem substantially. Virtual laboratories with audiovisual and force feedback make the understanding and analysis of many engineering courses possible. This paper presents the design and implementation of an interactive virtual control laboratory (IVCL) for university students studying engineering at the undergraduate level. In this laboratory, six experimental setups are designed and for each setup, five to six scenarios are considered. Therefore, a considerable amount of the classical concepts in control course and a selection of advanced concepts such as impedance control and fuzzy control are covered. Statistical analysis for both experimental and control groups’ pre-test and post-test indicates the effectiveness of this interactive virtual laboratory. For example, the mean scores for the experimental group was 21% higher in comparison with the control group and 18% higher in comparison with their own pre-test. Also, according to students’ responses to survey questions, a laboratory program is necessary for the control course and interactive virtual laboratory can compensate lack of a real laboratory. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A good understanding of the properties of standing waves will make the properly constructed structures withstand various risk factors. Some improperly constructed structures could damage or breakdown even in the presence of vibrations or strong winds.

There is an urgent need for clean and renewable energy sources. However, most renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, have very high initial costs, especially when used as a principal source. Distributed power generation using solar and wind power provides an effective solution to reduce the dependency on conventional power generation and to increase the reliability and quality of power systems. A mixture of distributed energy generation systems and loads can then be connected to form a microgrid.

10.1002/cpe.3049,A Web 2.0-based science gateway for massive remote sensing image processing,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"With the incessant expansion of applications and the frequent update of the software, Science Gateway for Massive Remote Sensing Image Processing (SGMRSIP), developed by client/server model or traditional browser/server model, has received more and more challenges. Fortunately, the Web 2.0 technologies, proposed in recent years, bring us a new user experience (UE) that has a fast response speed and a good interface. In particular, the remote sensing image can be processed smoothly in the absence of client software by Web 2.0 technologies. Hence, a Web 2.0-based browser/server model is designed for SGMRSIP to enhance the UE in this paper. Firstly, functions of a parallel remote sensing image processing portal, based on high performance cluster and client/server model, are summarized. And then, a Web 2.0-based interaction model is built, and all these functions are accomplished again on the basis of this model. Finally, the Web 2.0-based Science Gateway is achieved. In addition, we design different workflows for different satellite data, and all the processing tasks are finished successfully to verify the feasibility of this Science Gateway. The experimental results showed that the software scalability and interaction were improved and a better UE was achieved, compared with the existing SGMRSIP.

Scientific workflow managers are powerful tools for handling large computational tasks. Domain scientists find it difficult to create new workflows, so many tasks that could benefit from workflow automation are often avoided or performed by hand. Two technologies have come together to bring the benefits of workflow to the masses. The Pegasus Workflow Management System can manage workflows comprised of millions of tasks, all the while recording data about the execution and intermediate results so that the provenance of the final result is clear. The HUBzero platform for scientific collaboration provides a venue for building and delivering tools to researchers and educators. With the press of a button, these tools can launch Pegasus workflows on national computing infrastructures and bring results back for plotting and visualization. As a result, the combination of Pegasus and HUBzero is bringing high-throughput computing to a much wider audience. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In particular, science gateways have gained increasing interest from the e-Science community. These gateways allow hiding the complexity of the underlying resources that give support to the management of scientific data and to the execution of scientific applications. Based on our previous experience with the development of science gateways for diverse application domains in the Brazilian national high-performance computing network (SINAPAD), we have devised a rapid prototyping strategy to lower the barrier for scientific application developers to launch new science gateways. This strategy is based on two main tools. The first tool implements a gateway engine that can be configured by a small set of XML files. Such files completely define the desired functionality of a specific science gateway in the gateway engine. The gateway engine also offers other features not commonly found in related technologies, such as file sharing, data provenance tracking, and restricted anonymous access to underlying computational resources. The second tool implements both an editor and a packager for the aforementioned engine. This tool allows the developer to rapidly deploy and launch a new science gateway in ordinary Web application containers. In this paper, we present our results with the use of both tools in the SINAPAD network. We also discuss about the current limitations of both tools, as well as how we have been dealing with such limitations to provide a more comprehensive toolset to developers.

Radiotherapy-related activities such as the optimization of the therapeutic radiation dose to patients, workers' radioprotection, linear accelerator commissioning, quality assurance processes and technical innovations of linear accelerators are strongly based on the ability to predict the dose distribution. Monte Carlo based simulations are so far the most accurate tool for the calculation of dosimetric parameters, with the drawback of requiring extensive computing resources to achieve statistically meaningful results in a reasonable time frame. In the last years, advanced cancer treatment clinical and research communities have used e-Infrastructures to support their activities. The present paper reports on the development of a computing facility for helping clinical researchers in using modern R&E networking and distributed computing and storage resources for a new radiotherapy technique: the Intra-Operative Electron Radiotherapy.

10.1002/cpe.3283,Early experiences in developing and managing the neuroscience gateway,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"Summary The last few decades have seen the emergence of computational neuroscience as a mature field where researchers are interested in modeling complex and large neuronal systems and require access to high performance computing machines and associated cyber infrastructure to manage computational workflow and data. The neuronal simulation tools, used in this research field, are also implemented for parallel computers and suitable for high performance computing machines. But using these tools on complex high performance computing machines remains a challenge because of issues with acquiring computer time on these machines located at national supercomputer centers, dealing with complex user interface of these machines, dealing with data management and retrieval. The Neuroscience Gateway is being developed to alleviate and/or hide these barriers to entry for computational neuroscientists. It hides or eliminates, from the point of view of the users, all the administrative and technical barriers and makes parallel neuronal simulation tools easily available and accessible on complex high performance computing machines. It handles the running of jobs and data management and retrieval. This paper shares the early experiences in bringing up this gateway and describes the software architecture it is based on, how it is implemented, and how users can use this for computational neuroscience research using high performance computing at the back end. We also look at parallel scaling of some publicly available neuronal models and analyze the recent usage data of the neuroscience gateway. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

10.1002/cpe.3285,Recipes 2.0: Building for today and tomorrow,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"SummaryThe history of science gateway development has, in many ways, been a story of the 'Haves' vs. the 'Have-nots'. Large infrastructure projects led the way, building thick client portals to provide coherent interfaces to an incoherent environment. Contrast this with the way the modern Web is designed using light, front end components, and outsourcing much of the heavy lifting to a mash-up of REST application programming interfaces, and it is easy to see why modern web applications can be prototyped and refined into stable products in the time it previously took thick client portals to do an initial release. This paper argues that a 'build for today' philosophy can lead to the rapid development of science gateways to serve the 'Have-nots'. With this philosophy in mind, we are presenting Gateway DNA, a set of responsive front end components built on top of the iPlant Agave application programming interfaces. This toolkit provides the boilerplate for rapid development of lightweight science gateways using only HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

The primary obstacle to more widespread use of public clouds to host scientific software ('cloud-based science gateways') has thus far been the considerable gap between the specialized needs of science applications and the capabilities provided by cloud infrastructures. We describe here a domain-independent, cloud-based science gateway platform, the Globus Galaxies platform, which overcomes this gap by providing a set of hosted services that directly address the needs of science gateway developers. The design and implementation of this platform leverages our several years of experience with Globus Genomics, a cloud-based science gateway that has served more than 200 genomics researchers across 30 institutions. Building on that foundation, we have implemented a platform that leverages the popular Galaxy system for application hosting and workflow execution; Globus services for data transfer, user and group management, and authentication; and a cost-aware elastic provisioning model specialized for public cloud resources.

This process includes large computations that require advanced computing infrastructure; however, using rapidly evolving high-performance computing platforms can be difficult for biochemists. In this paper, we present a science gateway for virtual screening that has been tailored to the specific needs of our local users. The gateway provides user-friendly access to distributed computing infrastructures for high-throughput experiments with a few clicks. Its design is based on the generic layer developed for another gateway for neuroimaging data analysis, including data and computation management, as well as support for its operation. To facilitate scalability, the system architecture allows for adding new computing platforms to the back-end without affecting the front-end, from which the user can dynamically choose the preferred infrastructure.

10.1002/cpe.3519,The GenApp framework integrated with Airavata for managed compute resource submissions,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"A new framework (GenApp) for rapid generation of scientific applications running on a variety of systems including science gateways has recently been developed. This framework currently builds a GUI and/or web-based user interface for a variety of target environments on a collection of executable modules. The method for execution of modules has limited framework restrictions: primarily the requirement of wrapping the application to accept input and output formatted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Initial implementation supports direct execution on a user's workstation, a web server, or a compute resource accessible from the web server. After a successful initial workshop utilizing the framework to create a web-based user interface wrapping a scientific software suite, it was discovered that long-running jobs would sometimes fail, because of the loss of a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. This precipitated an improvement to the execution method with the bonus of easily allowing multiple web clients to attach to the running job. To support a diversity of queue managed compute resources, a Google 'Summer of Code' project was completed to integrate the Apache Airavata middleware as an additional execution model within the GenApp framework.

10.1002/cpe.3524,Reflections on science gateways sustainability through the business model canvas: Case study of a neuroscience gateway,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"The sustainability of science gateways has been a topic of active discussion because they have been created and supported in the context of temporary research and infrastructure projects. As successful projects come to an end, it is necessary to find (new) models to secure continuous exploitation of products generated by these projects. Taking this step requires business considerations that are not trivial to do from the role of a researcher. This paper presents our experiences in adopting a methodology from lean business development, the Business Model Canvas (BMC). This methodology enables structured reflection upon the business model and facilitates exploring alternative ones (pivoting). We have applied the BMC to one of the science gateways designed, developed, and operated by the Academic Medical Center (AMC) e-Science group: the AMC Computational Neuroscience Gateway. The current gateway BMC is explained in the paper and used as basis for a reflection to improve its sustainability. Alternative business models are given as examples of BMC iteration or pivots. This exercise helped us to structure the various aspects to be considered when designing or reflecting upon the business model of our gateway. It also facilitated the visualization of the complete business picture and helps the reflection about improvements in the business model toward sustainability.

We describe the motivation for enabling user contributions to the materials data and present the framework's features and challenges in the context of two real applications. These use cases illustrate how scientific collaborations can build applications with their own 'user-contributed' data using MPContribs. The Nanoporous Materials Explorer application provides a unique search interface to a novel dataset of hundreds of thousands of materials, each with tables of user-contributed values related to material adsorption and density at varying temperature and pressure. The Unified Theoretical and Experimental X-ray Spectroscopy application discusses a full workflow for the association, dissemination, and combined analyses of experimental data from the Advanced Light Source with MP's theoretical core data, using MPContribs tools for data formatting, management, and exploration. The capabilities being developed for these collaborations are serving as the model for how new materials data can be incorporated into the MP website with minimal staff overhead while giving powerful tools for data search and display to the user community. © Copyright 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","databases, materials science, science gateways, user-contributed data",1,0,0,1

Moreover, the accuracy of the simulation is strongly dependent on an extensive set of configuration parameters, which have to be selected in a consistent way among the models. Within the Distributed Research Infrastructure for Hydro-Meteorology project, a Web-based science gateway was developed with the aim to support HM researchers in designing, executing, and managing HM experiments. The core of this science gateway is the portal, which takes care of generating all the configuration files and handles the execution of simulation steps on a heterogeneous computing infrastructure composed of high-performance computing, Grid resources, and Cloud resources. This paper presents technological insights about the implementation of the portal, with an analysis of the adopted technologies and infrastructures.

While traditional risk communication follows a command and control structure such that information from hierarchical and vertically integrated organizations is disseminated to broader community, social media uses a decentralized, collaborative, and network based communication approach. The growth of information and communication technologies has made social media a popular channel for disseminating alert and warning messages both by citizens and agencies. However, social media suffers from spreading rumors and hoaxes. To minimize rumors and increase citizen communication, a science gateway (Cyber-Infrastructure for GeoInformatics and Community Resilience) has been deployed. This gateway, resulted from a research conducted along the Mississippi Gulf Coast communities, incorporates citizen science to evaluate warning message sources, message contents and dissemination channels to increase public response to warnings. This gateway built on the social construct of risk communication provides opportunities to citizens to share data and information about a hazard, and participate in building community resilience. © Copyright 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","contributory citizen science, resilience, risk communication, science gateways",1,0,0,1

Apache Airavata abstracts interactions between gateways and distributed computing infrastructures like Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment, international grids, and campus clusters. Airavata consists of several component services such as the API server, Orchestrator, Workflow Interpreter, Credential Store, and Application Factory. In addition, Airavata uses third party software, including RabbbitMQ for messaging, MySQL for production database management, and Apache Zookeeper for internal communications. In this paper, we discuss our initial experiences with leveraging open source technologies to manage Airavata and its dependent components to deploy, detect, and restart failed components in an auto-scaling platform. Such capabilities will allow Airavata services to be deployed in a wide area, large Virtual Machine (VM) based cluster, and a developer's laptop. The emerging technologies in cloud computing and Big Data that address these needs are the following: Docker, Marathon, and Apache Mesos. Docker is a Linux-based lightweight container that allows different applications to run isolated from each other but safely share the machine's resources. Docker images of applications can be published in registries and retrieved for execution in the target infrastructures. Marathon provides a cluster-wide init and control system for services, including Docker containers. Mesos provides a cluster-wide framework to schedule tasks based on fine-grained resource needs.

The Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) science gateway is one of the most popular gateways, with approximately 3000 active users since 2012, and the user base is growing each year. While increasing the number of compute resources available to CIPRES would address their growth needs, it also introduces additional complexity as the likelihood of failure increases. In this paper, we analyze historical job data from CIPRES and combine it with historical software and services monitoring data to create a machine learning model to predict where a user's job will complete successfully on resources. At one operating point of our classifier, we are able to detect 50% of jobs that will fail with a false detection rate less than 5%. In 2014, accurately predicting 50% of CIPRES job failures and redirecting them to other resources would have resulted in 900K compute core hours saved, furthering phylogenetic research.

The 2D “flattening” of photographs results in a significant loss of features especially if the photos were taken by one person. Automatically collecting and aligning photos in order to render 3D structures from 2D images without specialised equipment is currently a complex process that requires specialist knowledge with often limited results. In this paper, an Open Science oriented workflow is proposed where an on-line file system is used to share photos of an object or an environment and to produce a virtual reality scene as a navigable 3D reconstruction that can be shared with other people. Our workflow is based on a distributed e-Infrastructure and overcomes common limitations of other approaches by having all the used technology integrated on the same platform and by not requiring specialist knowledge. A performance evaluation of the 3D reconstruction process embedded in the workflow is reported against a commercial software and an open-source software in terms of computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, and three marine science use cases are reported to show potential applications of the workflow. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D reconstruction, cloud computing, e-infrastructures, open science, photogrammetry, photography, virtual reality, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Though current science gateways provide easy access to computing resources, data sets and tools specific to the disciplines, scientists often use slow and tedious manual efforts to perform knowledge discovery to accomplish their research/education tasks. Recommender systems can provide expert guidance and can help them to navigate and discover relevant publications, tools, data sets, or even automate cloud resource configurations suitable for a given scientific task. To realize the potential of integration of recommenders in science gateways in order to spur research productivity, we present a novel “OnTimeRecommend” recommender system. The OnTimeRecommend comprises of several integrated recommender modules implemented as microservices that can be augmented to a science gateway in the form of a recommender-as-a-service. The guidance for use of the recommender modules in a science gateway is aided by a chatbot plug-in viz., Vidura Advisor.

Due to its potential effects on coastal populations and global economies, sea level rise is a grave concern, making ice melt rates an important area of study. The ice-sheet science community consists of two groups that perform related but distinct kinds of research: a data community, and a model building community. The data community characterizes past and current states of the ice sheets by assembling data from field and satellite observations. The modeling community forecasts the rate of ice-sheet decline with computational models validated against observations. Although observational data and models depend on one another, these two groups are not well integrated. Better coordination between data collection efforts and modeling efforts is imperative if we are to improve our understanding of ice sheet loss rates. We present a new science gateway, GHub, a collaboration space for ice sheet scientists. This web-accessible gateway will host datasets and modeling workflows, and provide access to codes that enable tool building by the ice sheet science community. Using GHub, we will collect and centralize existing datasets, creating data products that more completely catalog the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. We will build workflows for model validation and uncertainty quantification, extending existing ice sheet models.

Digitalization of archaeological fragments provides an excellent research platform, useful to distant researchers. New experiential activities will be provided in the process of knowledge development, communication and sharing. All ages and levels of students make practical, effective use of the produced platform, where, using 3D models, they will study and recompose the past. The aim is to enrich the educational methods, so that they respond fully to sustainable economic and social development. The research presented is developed in two levels. The first creates digital laboratories, where students follow findings from revealing till exhibition. The second investigates the use of this platform as a management tool by professional users (archaeologists, historians, conservators) in order to elaborate fragments of objects or even the whole findings, without real contact. The project enables distant research and mainly the possibility to examine findings that may be lost in future. To meet the above objectives, high-accuracy digital copies and 3D models are of significant importance. The project investigates the potential of using a structured light scanner and image-based modeling. The multi-image techniques using images of findings taken from different angles, distances, level of illumination, create a dense point cloud in 3D space and develop an interface, which enables users to process it using simple tools. The produced ‘game’ offers a playful, interactive and engaging experience. The application developed encompasses important functionality (kinematics, collision detection, point intersection, movement validation, lightmapping, skinning, animation state machines). In addition, the environment of the tool enables the students to provide feedback about the application and the entire experience, which can be used for further study and improvement planning. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D textured model, Artifacts, Educational games, Educational programs, MVS, virtual laboratory, visualization",0,1,0,1

The research was developed between the periods 2019–1 and 2020–1, being the first period when face-to-face laboratories were taught, meanwhile the second period when the students were assisting classes through virtual platforms. The results of the research process indicate that there is a dependency between grades corresponding to 10% and 20% in each of the three periods for the 2019–1 semester and the 2020–1 semester, and it is evidenced that the number of students in the insufficient category in the 20% test decreased. Another representative finding is that the scores of professors’ subjective evaluations are consistent with the results within the standardized tests of the university under study. It is then concluded that the implementation of various virtual spaces for teaching allows knowledge development process to be better, where the opportunity is provided to a large number of resources or processes that could be expensive for universities in low-income countries. Similarly, virtual classrooms open the opportunity for more students, especially the ones from the most remote locations to be able to participate in the classes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Higher education institutions, Technologies towards teaching, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

This paper presents the implementation of conceptual maps in laboratory context of an engineering course unit as an active pedagogical approach to foster the students’ meaningful learning in times of COVID pandemic. Different methodologies of laboratory work are first presented, as well as the meaning of conceptual map. Then, an application example on how the conceptual map was introduced in a first laboratory class of Electrical Engineering, and also the students’ experiences and difficulties encountered when dealing with the practical implementation of conceptual maps, is illustrated. Finally, some relevant conclusions about the implementation of this active pedagogical approach are given, in particular the development of the students’ meaningful learning by exploring relationships between concepts, ideas or propositions, by addressing the most important differences and by revealing inconsistencies on the topics studied. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conceptual maps, Remote virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

As one of the significant reasons of this situation we see the fact that students are not in touch with domains where their use is desired and worth the effort. In this paper we deal with a toolset we developed to improve the situation. The toolset brings to students, in a virtual form, one of the most successful domains of formal methods application - railway systems. It consists of a modified version of a railway centralized traffic control simulator called Train Director and a tool that allows signals and switches in a railway scenario, simulated by Train Director, to be controlled by a separate formally developed control program. We briefly describe the toolset and its typical use within a formal methods course and discuss its usability with respect to various formal methods. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","formal methods, railway systems, software development, teaching, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The authors’ diagnosis of this problem is a technology barrier hard to overcome to people who want to focus only on science. The federated infrastructures are difficult to use not only due to the physical distribution of the resources and, thus, need for remote access, but, mainly, due to the fact that everyday patterns of interaction with a computer cannot be directly used for these resources. The way of performing computing operations on them is different than the usual way the scientists do their research using laptops or personal computers. The authors claim that the key to increase the use of modern federated infrastructures for science is making the processing on these infrastructures resemble using a personal computer. The paper collects requirements from different scientific use cases and, from these requirements, derives a processing model that could satisfy all of them, thus, allowing to build a system, in which computations on large infrastructures can be similar to everyday work.

Designing a functionally correct system, or a performance constrained system is fundamentally different in the sense that such design requires us to build models and to systematically refine models towards implementation such that correctness is preserved between refinements, and performance optimizations are introduced during refinements. Designing systems with cyber-security properties requires us to not only build models from theoretical principles, but also require modeling possible behaviors of an adversary. Modeling adversarial behavior is akin to test-driven model refinement, and hence not so different from certain approaches used when our goal is functionally correct design. However, for cyber-physical systems, we often need to detect an ongoing cyber attack since safe guards for cyber security often depend on assumptions which can be invalidated (e. g., insider attacks may invalidate perimeter security assumptions). Detecting ongoing attacks requires detecting behavioral anomalies in the physical system under cyber control – thus requiring us to build models from data. Machine learning approaches could be used to build such models. This we view as a schizoid approach – since the designer has to not only model the system from physical principles, he/she also has to build nominal behavioral models from data. While arguing this point of view, we introduce a virtual SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) laboratory we have built to help design cyber security of critical systems. The majority of this talk focuses on describing this software based virtual laboratory called VSCADA.

An international MBDA team has been set up to identify commonalities in any command and control application within the air defence scope. This work led to an open architecture that encapsulates elements that depend on weapon system specificities by the ones that are common. The common elements, covering surveillance, threat evaluation, weapon assignment and engagement control functions within the wide MBDA’s set of effectors, have been developed using MBDA Internal Research Funding and now are used to build up next-generation C2 solutions. The extendible concept behind the framework architecture allows the use of the ‘MBDA Extendible C2’ during the initial phases of the contract (assessment phase, derisking, demonstrator, research) and for the deployment phase by providing the possibility for closed-loop feedback within the customer. The need to work collaboratively across nations leads to the design and delivery of the MBDA Collaborative Environment (or CEM) solution that is a collaborative engineering virtual laboratory for members who are located in separate sites. This environment is protected, which therefore enables the efficient sharing of data between Italy and other entities. This environment is a desktop-virtualization-based technology that creates a cohesive and scalable solution and centralizes the Italian infrastructure. This reduces development time as it allows real-time development and review of design artefacts, reducing the risk of duplication of effort. It reduces development risk of misunderstanding due to parallel development activities. Furthermore, it reduces time and costs of information technology set-up and management, and shipment time and cost.

Supporting Big Data Applications,2016,Conference Paper,"Handling the complexity of relevant data (generated through information deluge and being targeted with Big Data technologies) requires new techniques with regard to data access, visualization, perception, and interaction for innovative and successful strategies. As a response to increased graphics performance in computing technologies and information visualization, Card et al. developed the Information Visualization Reference Model. Due to further developments in Information Systems as well as Data Analysis and Knowledge Management Systems in recent years, this reference model has to be adapted for addressing the recent advancements. Thus, the hybridly refined and extended IVIS4BigData Reference Model was derived from the original model to cover the new conditions of the present situation with advanced visual interfaces providing opportunities for perceiving, managing, and interpreting Big Data analysis results to support insight and emerging knowledge generation. After deriving the IVIS4BigData Model, the necessity to evaluate the appropriateness of this reference model existed. In this context, a full day workshop on Road Mapping Infrastructures for Advanced Visual Interfaces Supporting Big Data Applications in Virtual Research Environments was proposed and conducted at the Advanced Visual Interfaces conference 2016. This focused event for virtual research environment and human computer interaction research experts was utilized to present, discuss, and evaluate the derived IVIS4BigData reference model. In order to validate some of the properties of the derived model in a kind of pre-testing evaluation, all of these experts were asked to take part in a questionnaire before the start of the workshop and the corresponding results are outlined within this paper. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Advanced visual user interfaces, distributed big data analysis, Information visualization, IVIS4BigData, User empowerment, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Supporting Big Data Applications,2016,Conference Paper,"There are many systems that visualize abstract data in the context of Information Visualization (IVIS). However, most systems create unidirectional visualizations that represent a static product of the source data. Possible changes to the content of the visualization-if that is possible at all-are not reflected to the data sources. This paper recommends a theoretical approach to use modern Web technologies and state-of-the-art system architectures to conceptualize a synchronization-enabled Web-based 3D IVIS infrastructure. Within applications built on top of this infrastructure, clients are able to modify data properties within three-dimensional real-time visualizations. In consequence, these content modifications are automatically transmitted to the server-side data sources for persistence. Moreover, relevant content changes on the server side are broadcast to all registered clients to maintain a permanent consistent state between data sources and derived IVIS-products. Particularly, a Mediator-Wrapper architecture is used in order to semantically integrate heterogeneous data sources in Big Data scenarios. Note that this paper presents a theoretical approach and that validation and evaluation are future tasks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","3D information visualization, big data, Mediator-Wrapper architecture, Synchronization-enabled IVIS infrastructure",0,0,1,1

Supporting Big Data Applications,2016,Conference Paper,"Virtual Research Environments (VREs) are distributed and dynamic software environments that foster the collaboration of people from different disciplines by supporting the accomplishment of complex research tasks. VREs lack efficient and effective user interfaces able to satisfy the needs of the different types of people collaborating in performing certain tasks. Thus, a great challenge that VREs have to address is user diversity, which arises from different factors such as cultural background of users, their reasoning strategies, the way they carry out their tasks in their daily practices, and the languages and notations they are familiar with. This paper provides a solution to this challenge by proposing to create VREs that exploit the meta-design approach we have developed to design interactive systems that address user diversity. We then describe a mashup platform, built according to the meta-design approach, which supports non-technical users in accessing and manipulating information in VREs by enabling them to extract contents from heterogeneous sources and manipulate such content in their personal interactive environments, thus creating new content that can be shared among people collaborating to a task in a VRE. Finally, it is briefly discussed how this platform can be useful in some phases of the recently proposed model of Information Visualization for Big Data. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","data integration, Data visualization, Mashups, Web composition environments",0,0,1,1

This new configuration has permitted to develop new services for virtual universities. The Senegalese government has achieved policies to encourage young people to be interested in Science, Technology, and Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Thus, nowadays STEM education becomes a national priority. However, the STEM disciplines demand students to carry out hands-on experiments in laboratories. It goes without saying that integrating STEM education in the context of virtual universities needs implementation of remote laboratory platforms to perform e-learning activities. So, this paper suggests a new unified access platform. This is to control real and virtual components from any university working in partnership; which will facilitate hands-on experiments. To make our approach more relevant, some concrete scenarios of both real and virtual laboratory experiences were set to be applied for mathematics and computer science students of Senegal Virtual University (UVS).

However, users face difficulties while they perform complex operations via cyberinfrastructures by using their user interfaces (UIs), for big data analysis and research. Using these infrastructures users perform operations such as data access, data visualization to complete their research activities. Unfortunately, there are not enough studies and projects conducted so far that provides guidelines to developers to design and develop interfaces that meet user requirements in cyberinfrastructures. These infrastructures are also known as e-infrastructures, big data infrastructures, open data infrastructures, virtual research environments. In this work, guidelines are recommended so that user requirements can directly be incorporated into the design and development of cyberinfrastructure applications serving a particular target audience. In this paper, an example of a cyberinfrastructure is given, using which users can be involved in its design and the development. These techniques can then also be transferred to the designers and developers of other cyberinfrastructures to improve the user experience as well as usability of UIs and associated services.

This is especially relevant within the field of engineering where many teachers are beginning to use sophisticated virtual laboratories (VL) and computer applications in the classroom. Indeed, results of many teaching experiences validate the usefulness of such virtual tools due to their high efficiency in the teaching-learning process. However, some of the ICT tools and applications used in engineering education are becoming excessively complex and require extensive training to use them, which may be even more difficult than the knowledge they wish to teach. This communication deals with the development of new teaching technologies used in Materials Science and Engineering, specifically a VL based on the step-by-step performance of a Rockwell hardness testing machine. To achieve this goal, a realistic 3D scenario based on non-immersive virtual reality design −similar to the usual videogame environments − is used to increase students’ motivation regarding the study of hardness testing of metals. Like any virtual tool which begins to be used, some changes or potential areas of improvement will arise when applied in the classroom during the subsequent years.

The first experiment covers the popular problem of protein folding process simulation and investigates the correctness of the ""Fuzzy Oil Drop"" model (FOD) [3], on over 60 thousands of proteins deposited in Protein Data Bank [18]. The FOD model assumes the hydrophobicity distribution in proteins to be accordant with the 3D Gauss function differentiating the hydrophobicity density from the highest in the center of the molecule, to zero level on the surface. The second experiment focuses on performing comparison of proteins that belong to the same family. Examination of proteins alignment at three different levels of protein description may lead to identifying a conservative area in protein family, which is responsible for the protein function.

Due to the high computational costs that are necessary to produce virtual environments (VEs), the potential for photorealism is sacrificed. Often these three-dimensional (3D) modeled applications use an unrealistic VE and, therefore, do not provide a full depiction of real-world environments. Panoramas can be used to showcase complex scenarios that are difficult to model and are computationally expensive to view in virtual reality (VR). Utilizing 360° panoramas can provide a low-cost and quick-to-capture alternative with photorealistic representations of the actual environment. The advantages of photorealism over 3D models for training and education are not clearly defined. This paper initially summarizes the development of a VR training application and initial pilot study. Quantitative and qualitative study then was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a 360° panorama VR training application and a 3D modeled one. Switching to a mobile VR headset saves money, increases mobility, decreases set-up and breakdown time, and has less spatial requirements. Testing results of the 3D modeled VE group had an average normalized gain of 0.03 and the 360° panorama group, 0.43. Although the 3D modeled group had slightly higher realism according to the presence questionnaire and had slightly higher averages in the comparative analysis questionnaire, the 360° panorama application has shown to be the most effective for training and the quickest to develop. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Virtual field trip, virtual laboratories, virtual reality, Virtual training",0,1,0,1

Better understanding of the symmetry of molecules requires high visual-spatial thinking ability. Conventional teaching methodologies, with limited teaching aides, fall short in providing a detailed understanding of scientific theories and related concepts. Incorrect understanding has been known to perpetrate concepts that are not consistent with the consensus of the research community or alternate conceptions. This work elaborates a methodology designed to discover the alternate conceptions stemming from teaching molecular symmetry in a typical classroom environment and the impact of the virtual laboratory (VL) environment in correcting these misconceptions. Three significant contributions presented in this paper include: (1) the development of a media and information-intense VL experiment platform designed to enhance understanding of symmetry elements and point groups of molecules with diverse structural geometries. (2) the development of an instrument, Molecular symmetry Alternate Conception Test (MACT), designed to capture and estimate the extent of alternate conceptions. (3) the successful identification of typical alternate conceptions amongst students in the context of molecular symmetry. In addition to perceived alternate concepts in symmetry education, the results indicate a significant statistical improvement of 156% in understanding of molecular symmetry concepts (p < 0.05) after subjecting students to the interactive VL platform. This study also shows identifying bond angles and planarity as concepts crucial for students. It is also implicit that estimations of discrimination skills related to identifying concept-based learning may be relevant for perceiving alternate concepts among learners. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alternate conception, information and communications technology, Molecular symmetry, Symmetry operations, Virtual lab simulation, web-based learning",0,1,0,1

10.1007/s10723-012-9243-2,Assessing the Usability of a Science Gateway for Medical Knowledge Bases with TRENCADIS,Journal of Grid Computing,2012,Article,"Biomedical applications are often built on top of knowledge bases that contain medical images and clinical reports. Currently, these bases are being used to improve diagnosis, research and teaching, but in many cases, the infrastructure required has a prohibitive cost for many medical centres. However, resources can be attached from existing e-Science infrastructures. Therefore, many efforts have been made to establish best practices that allow the use of such infrastructures. However, e-Science relies on open, distributed, collaborative environments, built on top of very specialized technologies, such as Grid and Cloud computing, which require reasonable technical skills for their usage. Therefore, science gateways have become essential tools that assist users in interacting with e-Science applications. This paper describes TRENCADIS, a technology that supports the creation and operation of virtual knowledge bases. To this end, it provides developers with components and APIs for building secure data services that can be annotated and queried through ontology templates, based on DICOM and DICOM-SR. This technology was used in this paper to build a gateway for assisting diagnosis and research in breast cancer. We also present here the results of a study conducted to evaluate the gateway, from the point of view of the usability perceived by a group of physicians and radiologists. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DICOM, DICOM-SR, knowledge base, usability",1,0,0,1

Gateways have been shown to support many common and advanced requirements, as well as proving successful as a shared access mode to production cyberinfrastructure such as the TG/XSEDE. There are two primary challenges in the design of effective and broadly-usable gateways: the first revolves around the creation of interfaces that catpure existing and future usage modes so as to support desired scientific investigation. The second challenge and the focus of this paper, is concerned about the requirement to integrate the user-interfaces with computational resources and specialized cyberinfrastructure in an interoperable, extensible and scalable fashion. Currently, there does not exist a commonly usable middleware to that enables seamless integration of different gateways to a range of distributed and high-performance infrastructures. The development of multiple similar gateways that can work over a range of production cyberinfrastructures, usage modes and application requirements is not scalable without a effective and extensible middleware. Some of the challenges that make using production cyberinfrastructure as a collective resource difficult are also responsible for the absence of middleware that enables multiple gateways to utilize the collective capabilities. We introduce the SAGA-based, Distributed Application Runtime Environment (DARE) framework, using which gateways that seamlessly and effectively utilize scalable distributed infrastructure can be built. We discuss the architecture of DARE-based gateways, and show using several different prototypes-DARE-HTHP, DARE-NGS, how gateways can be constructed by utilizing the DARE middleware framework. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","clouds, DARE, EGI, grids, interoperability, middleware, Pilot Jobs, SAGA, science gateways, standards, XSEDE",1,0,0,1

There is a huge number of applications available to work with structural data on large scale. Using these tools on distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs), however, is often complicated due to a lack of suitable interfaces. The MoSGrid (Molecular Simulation Grid) science gateway provides an intuitive user interface to several widely-used applications for structural bioinformatics, molecular modeling, and quantum chemistry. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data via a granular security concept, which covers all layers of the infrastructure. The security concept applies SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and allows trust delegation from the user interface layer across the high-level middleware layer and the Grid middleware layer down to the HPC facilities. SAML assertions had to be integrated into the MoSGrid infrastructure in several places: the workflow-enabled Grid portal WS-PGRADE (Web Services Parallel Grid Runtime and Developer Environment), the gUSE (Grid User Support Environment) DCI services, and the cloud file system XtreemFS. The presented security infrastructure allows a single sign-on process to all involved DCI components and, therefore, lowers the hurdle for users to utilize large HPC infrastructures for structural bioinformatics. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DCIs, science gateways, security, Single sign-on, Structural bioinformatics",1,0,0,1

The science gateway MoSGrid (Molecular Simulation Grid) is a valuable and user-friendly workbench to submit and process molecular simulation studies on a large scale. With regard to the needs of the users, we focus on the interoperability of simulations using two prominent quantum chemical codes, Gaussian09 and NWChem. At a first glimpse, the definition of functionals and basis sets seems to be sufficient to evoke the same type of calculation in both codes using the quantum chemical workflows in MoSGrid. In more detail, this is not true and more aspects such as integration grids, convergence criteria and basis set dimensions have to be well defined in order to obtain a trustworthy comparability between quantum chemical codes. In previous work, these details have not been defined and included in the MSML (Molecular Simulation Markup Language) implementation within MoSGrid. After the investigation presented here, all these details can be integrated to extend the quantum chemical workflows in MoSGrid.

The integration of such frameworks with Big Data processing tools on the cloud opens new opportunities for application developers. This paper investigates how workflow systems and science gateways can be extended with Big Data processing capabilities. A generic approach based on infrastructure aware workflows is suggested and a proof of concept is implemented based on the WS-PGRADE/gUSE science gateway framework and its integration with the Hadoop parallel data processing solution based on the MapReduce paradigm in the cloud.

Such resources are often used for clinical matchmaking and allow information on patients and patient disorders to be shared by clinicians with wider biomedical research communities outside of a given hospital setting, and potentially with patients and/or patient advisory groups. Whilst addressing aspects of clinical collaborations through making targeted biomedical data accessible - such registries are really only a starting point for what can be achieved to support research collaborations. In particular, registries should ideally be augmented with a portfolio of additional service offerings that facilitate secure research collaborations: bio-banking and bio-sample data tracking capabilities; support for feasibility analysis on clinical trials and studies; offer seamless data transfer to/from clinical trials; provide search and analytical capabilities in a user-driven research environment.

These matrices contain information for each object which have to be identified using complex algorithms to interrogate the data. They are normally generated by combining the results of running such algorithms across various datasets from different and distributed data sources. Thus for non-computing experts the generation of such matrices prove a barrier to employing machine learning techniques. Further since datasets are becoming larger this barrier is augmented by the limitations of the single personal computer most often used by investigators to carry out such analyses. Here we propose a user friendly system to generate feature matrices in a way that is flexible, scalable and extendable. Additionally by making use of The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software, the process can be speeded up using distributed volunteer computing possible in most institutions.

A web-based virtual laboratory was developed to provide learners with the opportunity to examine the influence of physical factors on gas solubility in water. An evaluation process involving 180 students revealed that the concepts connected to the dissolution of gas in water caused problems for the students even after having experimented with the virtual laboratory. To investigate the nature of learners' reasoning about the visualised events, 13 video-recorded groups of learners were analysed. This study follows the reasoning of one group that displayed a possibly productive way of solving the problem. The results address the students' general difficulty of discovering something that they are conceptually unprepared for within the virtual laboratory. The analysis shows how the students eventually found a way out of their dilemma by making an analogy with other dissolving processes. In effect, the analysis elucidates some of the analytical work that had to be done by the participants when collaboratively negotiating a shared meaning of a scientific concept in concord with a given task and set of instructional materials. Implications for design might be to provide the learning material with explicit hints that enable students to connect to specific phenomena related to the one investigated concept. The findings show the usefulness of video analytic research, informed by CA and ethnomethodology.

Nevertheless, these previous works rest upon the assumption that the knowledge that is learned in virtual laboratories transfers to its equivalent real task. The main contribution of this work is to validate that the knowledge obtained by students in an undergraduate robotics course using computer simulations of 3D model robots can be applied to its real-world context. The experimental platform used to run the computer simulations was based on the Simscape Multibody library of the MATLAB™ software. Results show a satisfactory knowledge transfer because more than 75% of the students finished a forward kinematics problem using a physical manipulator built with LEGO Mindstorms™. In addition, the observation analysis of the professor reveals that students reinforced their knowledge previously learned, and their problem-solving and critical thinking skills also improved.

Our seminal work delineates and elaborates on the principles, development and implementation of a specially-designed adaptive, virtual laboratory. Aims: We strived to teach laboratory skills associated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme kinetics to 2nd-year biochemistry students using our adaptive learning platform. Pertinent specific aims were to:. (1)design/implement a web-based lesson to teach lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) enzyme kinetics to 2nd-year biochemistry students(2)determine its efficacious in improving students' comprehension of enzyme kinetics(3)assess their perception of its usefulness/manageability(vLab versus Conventional Tutorial). Methods: Our tools were designed using HTML5 technology. We hosted the program on an adaptive e-learning platform (AeLP). Provisions were made to interactively impart informed laboratory skills associated with measuring LDH enzyme kinetics. A series of e-learning methods were created. Tutorials were generated for interactive teaching and assessment. Results: The learning outcomes herein were on par with that from a conventional classroom tutorial. Student feedback showed that the majority of students found the vLab learning experience ""valuable"" and the vLab format/interface ""well-designed"". However, there were a few technical issues with the 1st roll-out of the platform. Conclusions: Our pioneering effort resulted in productive learning with the vLab, with parity with that from a conventional tutorial. Our contingent discussion emphasises not only the cornerstone advantages, but also the shortcomings of the AeLP method utilised. We conclude with an astute analysis of possible extensions and applications of our methodology. © 2016.","Adaptive e-learning, AeLP, Enzyme Kinetics, HTML5, Laboratory skills, Lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, virtual labs, VLab",0,1,0,1

LBflow is validated against analytical, numerical and experimental results for a range of three-dimensional flow geometries. The fluid conductance of prismatic pipes with various cross sections is calculated with LBflow and found to be in excellent agreement with published results. Simulated flow along sinusoidally constricted pipes gives good agreement with experimental data for a wide range of Reynolds number. The permeability of packs of spheres is determined and shown to be in excellent agreement with analytical results. The accuracy of internal flow patterns within the investigated geometries is also in excellent quantitative agreement with published data.

The code has been developed with geophysical applications in mind, and is designed to be usable by those with no specialist computational fluid dynamics expertise. LBflow provides a 'virtual laboratory' which can be used, rapidly and easily, to obtain accurate flow data for the geometrically complex, three-dimensional flows that abound in geophysical systems. Parameters can be 'steered' by the user at runtime to allow efficient and intuitive exploration of parameter space. LBflow is written in object-oriented C++ and adopts a modular approach. Lattice Boltzmann algorithms for distinct classes of material are encoded in separate modules, which implement a standard interface, and which are linked to LBflow dynamically at runtime. This allows users with programming skill and expertise in the lattice Boltzmann method to create and share new LBflow modules, extending functionality. A companion application, LBview, provides a graphical user interface to LBflow and renders a user-configurable visualization of the output. LBflow's output can be piped directly to LBview allowing realtime visualization of steered flow. LBview also facilitates analysis of the data generated by LBflow.

10.1016/j.ces.2011.05.029,Meso-scale oriented simulation towards virtual process engineering (VPE)-The EMMS Paradigm,Chemical Engineering Science,2011,Article,"With the dramatic development of computational science and technology, computer simulation is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and engineering practice, and is believed to bring about a profound revolution to the mode and means of these activities. For chemical engineering, it will promote the transition from an experience-and-experiment-based research and development mode to the one based on virtual process engineering (VPE). However, such a revolution still requires tremendous improvements in the Accuracy of physical modeling and numerical methods, the Capability of the computing hardware and software, and the Efficiency of the simulation activities, or in short, ACE. This article will systematically review the 3-decade endeavors at IPE, CAS (Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences) on upgrading ACE by establishing a multi-scale computing paradigm focusing on meso-scale structures. We also report recent developments in this direction with projections on future work. Meso-scales refer to the intermediate scales at which the discrete elements in a system interact to shape the global behavior of the system. Reasonable description of the structures at such scales is a bottleneck for reliable and accurate modeling of global behaviors. To address this problem, we started from gas-solid flow by proposing the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model to quantify the hydrodynamics of meso-scale structures in gas-solid fluidization. This model, that is, its stability condition, was thoroughly analyzed and verified with the pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) method. Other systems, such as turbulence and gas-liquid flow, were then studied following the same strategy, revealing the ubiquity of stability conditions for meso-scale structures as a result of the compromise among different dominant mechanisms, and leading to a generalized model mathematically formulated as a multi-objective variational (MOV) problem. Meanwhile, along with wider industrial applications of the EMMS-based simulation methods, common features were recognized that ACE requires structural consistency among the simulated system, the physical model, the numerical software and the computing hardware under the umbrella of MOV, which we have named as the EMMS Paradigm. The EMMS Paradigm was first implemented from the software level using traditional computing hardware to achieve Accuracy. Since 2007, with the development of general-purpose GPU (graphic processing unit) computing, CPU (central processing unit)-GPU hybrid computing was deployed to implement the Paradigm from the hardware level, boosting the Capability to Petaflops range. In applying the Paradigm to the development of an industrial petro-chemical process (maximizing iso-paraffins, MIP), enabling technologies such as pre- and post-processing, error-tolerance, network-based computing and seamless integration of different simulation methods are now under development, which will greatly improve the Efficiency. A demonstration virtual laboratory featuring the comparison and interaction of online measurement and real-time computing is under construction. With these endeavors, an industrial process could be simulated globally in almost real-time, and different levels of details could be traced from the global distribution of flow parameters in a reactor to the inner-channels of catalytic particles at a perceivable evolution speed. The realization of VPE is, therefore, in the foreseeable future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex system, GPU computing, Meso-scale, Multi-phase flow, Multi-scale, Virtual process engineering",0,1,0,1

Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in biomedical laboratories make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system.

New approach and new specific knowledge are needed to develop such a system. We expect to meet the requirements of distance learning by developing the software-based laboratory exercises, i.e., a virtual laboratory. To fully substitute a physical system like laboratory equipment, one must emulate its full dynamics. The mathematical model in the form of differential equations will be applied to calculate dynamics and provide the data that would otherwise be measured on a physical system - this means simulation.

Virtual laboratories, by overcoming some limitations of conventional hands-on experiments, have been adopted as a complement or in substitution of laboratory sessions.

One of the virtual labs is intended to fully replace the hands-on experiment and consists on the determination of the correlation between oxygen transfer rate, aeration rate and agitation power in a reactor. The other virtual lab consists on the determination of the residence time distribution (RTD) in continuous stirred tanks series and was implemented to support the physical experiments rather than replacing them. The virtual labs provide the students a learning platform covering the fundamentals underlying the experiment, its pre-visualization and simulation.

These academic tools must be user-friendly for teachers and students and easy to adapt to practical cases. The Chemical and Environmental Engineering Group (GIQA) at University Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) has developed a Kinetic, Modeling and Simulation (KMS) platform for chemical and biochemical processes. The KMS platform provides different simulation applications programmed in Matlab® with a friendly interface design environment for users. In this work, we will focus on the Kinetics in Conventional Activated Sludge (KCAS) application, as part of the KMS platform. The design of kinetic models and the dynamic simulation of wastewater treatment plants are typically implemented by a variety of dedicated software, mostly developed for research and development purposes at universities, institutes or consulting companies. These programming tools have inherent weaknesses as simulators in virtual laboratories for academics, needing steep learning curves and lacking flexibility to evaluate complex problems, particularly in bachelor degrees programs that are not completely devoted to the mathematical modeling of processes. The simplicity and versatility of KCAS simulator make it very useful for students as starting educational tool to define kinetic models and to make the dynamic simulation of a conventional activated sludge reactor followed by a secondary decanter using different inlet streams or operation conditions. The students interact with the program through a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the results can be easily exported to a conventional spreadsheet in EXCEL© format files. With KCAS, the students can formulate kinetic models (potential models, diffusional models, Monod equations, etc.) to simulate the evolution from simple reaction systems, to complex biochemical models such as ASM (Activated Sludge Models) from the International Water Association (IWA).

In addition, data on FBOs are mostly scattered in different formats either in national databases and reports or within pathogen-specific or regional reporting networks, both of which are often only accessible to a selected number of individuals. Here, we developed an international, open, shared and searchable data catalogue of past FBOs – the Global Food-source Identifier (GFI). GFI was developed with two objectives: a) to create a collaborative online community of FBO investigators, encouraging the international sharing of data in a harmonized, detailed and comparable manner and b) to support foodborne outbreak investigation worldwide by providing access to detailed records of past outbreaks, which can convey valuable insight into potential ‘risk foods’ of a detected pathogen. GFI is hosted within a Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which offers additional features to facilitate the collaboration between the outbreak investigators. These features allow document exchange, communication and data visualization and analysis between the VRE members. Based on scientific literature on foodborne outbreaks and discussions within a working group, we selected a total of 46 attributes characterising the outbreak records to be included in the catalogue, aggregated under the four overarching categories causative agent, epidata, food source and report details. Detailed descriptions of the attributes in the catalogue and instructions for harmonized data reporting are available on a wiki page in the VRE. At the time of writing and public launch of GFI, the data catalogue was populated with records of 102 FBOs occurred in Denmark over a period of 12 years (2005–2016) and covering the most frequent pathogens and a broad range of typing methods. The VRE features that enable data analysis, document sharing and communication between members were applied for the graphical representation of the records available in GFI, and for the sharing of results and script files within the VRE. The descriptive analysis included the relationship between the most frequent causative agents and outbreak food sources. Such results can support a risk-based food sampling strategy in the very beginning of a foodborne outbreak investigation.

Twenty-one remote sites have participated in SNET, which reached a speed of 1 Gbps in April 2009. The SNET is a closed network system based on L2 and L3VPN provided by SINET3, which is a national academic network operated by the National Institute of Informatics. SNET has been successfully supporting the remote participation of various sizes and types of experimental equipments and has also been supporting the remote use of a supercomputer. In this paper, we describe the configuration of SNET, which is overcoming the challenges that arise in virtual laboratories; we mainly explain the remote participation in the experiment. Remarks about the remote participation regarding the ITER activity, massive data transfer, and GRID are also discussed.

By extending the LABCOM data system developed at LHD, FVL supports (i) and (ii) so that it can deal with not only LHD data but also the data of two remote experiments: QUEST at Kyushu University and GAMMA10 at University of Tsukuba. FVL has applied the latest ""cloud"" technology for both data acquisition and storage architecture. It can provide us high availability and performance scalability of the whole system. With a well optimized TCP data transferring method, the unified data access platform for both experimental data and numerical computation results could become realistic on FVL.

As a solution we have proposed the Grid Operation Invoker (GOI) which offers an object-oriented method invocation semantics for interacting with diverse computational services. GOI forms the core of the ViroLab virtual laboratory and it is used to invoke operations from within in-silico experiments described using a scripting notation. We describe the details of GOI (including architecture, technology adapters and asynchronous invocations) focusing on a mechanism which allows adding high-level support for batch job processing middleware, e.g. EGEE LCG/gLite. As an example, we present the NAMD molecular dynamics program, deployed on EGEE infrastructure.

Such resources include dictionaries, thesauri, corpora, images, audio and video collections. These resources are typically distributed, and comprise non-interoperable repositories of data that are often licence protected. In this context, researchers typically conduct their research through direct access to individual web-based resources. This form of research is non-scalable, time consuming and often frustrating to the researchers. The JISC funded project Enhancing Repositories for Language and Literature Researchers (ENROLLER, http://www.gla.ac.uk/ enroller/) aims to address this by provision of an interactive, research infrastructure providing seamless access to a range of major language and literature repositories. This paper describes this infrastructure and the services that have been developed to overcome the issues in access and use of digital resources in humanities. In particular, we describe how high performance computing facilities including the UK e-Science National Grid Service (NGS, http://www.ngs.ac.uk) have been exploited to support advanced, bulk search capabilities, implemented using Google's MapReduce algorithm.

Learners can access such laboratories to support their practical learning of mechatronics without the need to set up laboratories at their own institutions. The cloud infrastructure enables multiple laboratories to come together virtually to create an ecosystem for educators and learners. From such a system, educators can pick and mix materials to create suitable courses for their students and the learners can experience different types of devices and laboratories through the cloud. The paper provides an overview of this new cloud-based e-learning approach and presents the results.

The final model will be used as a template for external galaxies to study star formation across the cosmic time. The adopted agile software development process allowed to fulfill the community needs in terms of required workflows and underlying resource monitoring. Scientific requirements arose during the process highlighted the needs for easy parameter setting, fully embarrassingly parallel computations and large-scale input dataset processing.

They find widespread adoption by research groups to share data, code and tools both amongst collaborators on a project and the broader community. However, not unlike research groups, gateways too, face the vagaries of research funding often resulting in a bleak outlook for their maintenance beyond the original project's conclusion. We present a sustainability model based on the HUBzero cyberinfrastructure platform that enables multiple research projects to share a single science gateway allowing for their maintenance even after the original funding source has run out. This model brings with it certain other advantages as well; general improvements to the gateway apply to all hosted projects, similar requirements across projects can often be abstracted into new general purpose capabilities for the gateway which feed back into all hosted projects. Such newly developed capabilities can also foster additional research aiding in new funding proposals that can revitalize and jumpstart hosted dormant projects. We describe a specific instance of a HUBzero science gateway, MyGeoHub, that successfully employs this sustainability model to host several geospatial research projects.

Given their heterogeneous nature, CPS are naturally designed in the so-called simulation-centric process, where physical equipment design are translated into behavioral simulation models. Although many tools exist to ease the design phase in the different disciplines, their full integration is still an open problem. This fact holds particularly true in a control-design perspective, given that in a CPS the “plant” has a heterogeneous nature, and the design of model-based, advanced control techniques would strongly benefit from the availability of a common modelling environment. In this paper, we try to enhance this simulation-centric process by introducing a pure simulation kind of prototype, based on the co-simulation of the firmware and of the multi-physical controlled system. We introduce some innovative tools, implemented in µLab/CfL, and discuss upon their impact towards a better collaborative design and integration during the design of CPS.

The advances in Internet and network technology have produced web technologies which make it possible to offer platform or software as a service via the web, making it possible for end users to access computer resources or specialized computer tools remotely. However, the high cost of image acquisition, the limited availability of medical image analysts, and the limited collaborative efforts between medical experts and scientists are major challenges for medical image analysis in the developing world. The aim of this project was to develop a medical image e-infrastructure called Medical Image Processor and Analysis (MIPAR) to contain a repository of medical images acquired from Africa and a platform for processing medical images. Methods: The backend of MIPAR which is resident on a High-Performance Computing infrastructure was built using FutureGateway, a framework for building science gateway. The image upload and download module was built upon the framework of Open Access Repository with the front end developed using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. JavaScript and JQuery were used for scripting. User's access to the server is controlled with HTTP response and a Client-Server Architecture, while the image processing tools on the server side communicate with PHP using Representational State Architecture (REST) API. Results: MIPAR was tested using brain MRI images. Images were submitted remotely via MIPAR's web interface and kept in the repository. Image processing facility of MIPAR was tested using the brain extraction module, a 3D image of approximately 43MB was successfully brain extracted within 60 s.

The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Klimeck et al., 2007[10]) is introduced by carefully investigating the utility of III-V semiconductor quantum dots as infrared photodetectors at a wavelength of 1.2-1.5 μm. We not only present a detailed description of the simulation methodology coupled to the atomistic sp3d5s* tight-binding band model, but also validate the suggested methodology with a focus on a proof of principle on small GaAs quantum dots (QDs). Then, we move the simulation scope to optical properties of realistically sized dome-shaped InAs/GaAs QDs that are grown by self-assembly and typically contain a few million atoms. Performing numerical experiments with a variation in QD size, we not only show that the strength of ground state inter-band light transitions can be optimized via QD size-engineering, but also find that the hole ground state wavefunction serves as a control factor of transition strengths. Finally, we briefly introduce the web-based cyber infrastructure that is developed as a government-funded project to support online education and research via TCAD simulations. This work not only serves as a useful guideline to experimentalists for potential device designs and other modelers for the self-development of optical TCAD, but also provides a good chance to learn about the science gateway project ongoing in the Republic of Korea. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Atomistic modeling, III-V photodetector, Optoelectronics, Parallel computing, science gateways, Tight-binding",1,0,0,1

The main difference with the usual Earth-based laboratories is that we cannot control the experiments. Instead, we have no choice but to create virtual laboratories on Earth, in order to simulate all the relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments. This implies a realistic treatment of stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics. Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses that are routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and stellar collisions, respectively. I outline the main steps that need to be taken in order to embed and where needed transform these legacy codes in order to produce a far more modular and robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems. The time is right to do so: within a few years computers will reach the required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a star cluster with a million stars for 10 billion years, while resolving the internal binary and multiple star motions. By that time simulation software will be the main bottleneck in our ability to analyze dense stellar systems. Only through full-scale simulations will we be able to critically test our understanding of the 'microphysics' of stellar collisions and their aftermath, in a direct comparison with observations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Space and Planetary Science, Astronomy and Astrophysics, astrophysics, High Energy Physics - Theory, computational physics, Star formation, Astronomy, Metallicity, Star cluster, physics, Stellar evolution, astrophysics, Stellar mass, Stellar physics, Stellar dynamics, Stellar collision",0,1,0,1

The main goal of the proposed robotic prototype is to deal with the current situation of pandemic contingency, where students and instructors cannot attend laboratory facilities in person. The robotic system has four main components: an electromechanical robot arm structure, a control system, a Wi-Fi communications module, and a human-machine interface. The IoT (Internet of Things) robot arm can be used to demonstrate important robotics topics such as direct and inverse kinematics, which are shown by programming simple and complex motions using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) methodology. The capabilities of the robotic system are empowered by IoT technology, which is demonstrated with an HMI interface deployed in a smartphone using wireless Wi-Fi communication through an ESP32 microcontroller. The arm's purpose is to be a low-cost and replicable robot that aids the comprehension of robotics design through project-based learning, from the theoretical aspects to the actual coding and construction of a prototype. © 2020 The Author(s)","educational innovation, higher education, Online teaching, robot kinematics, Teaching robotics, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Metrology laboratory work is much more appealing and highlights the difficulties encountered in interpreting specifications and the inherent method uncertainties. Nevertheless, metrology activities require an expensive metrology laboratory equipped with CMMs. In order to carry out real hands-on experiments, Bordeaux University is designing a virtual laboratory framework. It is integrated into Moodle (an L.M.S., Learning Management System) as a new activity to establish a link with other Moodle learning activities (courses, tests, etc.) and to ensure student tracking. A first prototype of the virtual laboratory is dedicated to dimensional and geometrical metrology with simulated traditional measuring devices (gauge, micrometer, dial indicator, etc.) and Coordinate Measuring Machines.

Thermodynamics experiments are used for its validation. Classical numerical resolution of thermodynamics problems comes up against the number and variability of boundary conditions. Based on molecular dynamics, a multiagent approach is proposed, resting upon agent spatial and temporal autonomy. This approach grants each particle a capacity to identify its environment using both its own clock and perceptive area. Individual molecular properties are injected into thermal and mechanical models, and macroscopic gas behaviors can be detected and quantified by 3D virtual instruments, created in order to involve the user into the simulation. In order to assess its ability to simulate thermodynamic experiments, our method is applied to classical situations, such as the Joule-Gay Lussac experiment or the maxwellian relaxation in a hard-sphere gas. The simulated gas behavior is in good agreement with theoretical results for gases without interaction. Taking into account the volume of the molecules, our method also allows to quantify the mean free path and the average collision time for Neon and Xenon hard-sphere gases at equilibrium. Dynamic speed relaxation from uniform to maxwellian distribution is simulated successfully, and molecular covolume are also measured with such virtual gases.","Multiagent architecture, Thermodynamics, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

This is especially the case when dealing with rare diseases where a lack of data, information and/or sharing of expertise can cause delays in progressing the understanding and potential diagnosis/treatment of such diseases. Research into adrenal tumours is one such area where co-ordination of international cancer efforts is essential. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours - Structuring clinical research on adrenal cancers in adults (ENS@T-CANCER) project has recently been funded by the European Union to establish a state of the art Virtual Research Environment (VRE) supporting all aspects of international research and collaboration into the aetiology, diagnosis and establishing optimal treatment strategies for patients with adrenal cancer. It is envisaged that this VRE will comprise a portfolio of clinical databases for the different types of adrenal tumours that exist; support and integrate a seamless federation of adrenal tumour bio-banks with support for bio-sample tracking; support a wide range of -omics research into adrenal tumours and allow results to be shared amongst collaborators; offer advanced visualization services, and support several large-scale clinical trials comprising cohorts of patients with different kinds/treatments of adrenal tumours. This paper outlines the goals of the ENS@T-CANCER project and outlines the on-going implementation work. We show how security-oriented information can be collected and tracked through the VRE including supporting collection of clinical data sets and their linkage with associated bio-samples in an ethically-driven framework. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adrenal tumours, Biobanks, Ethics, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

There is great potential in applying a 3D virtual lab based games to support teaching and learning in science. Moreover, it is significant to find practical ways to design and develop intelligent systems based on 3D games with limited complexity forms. 3D virtual environments provide an immersion into the learning contents, and interactions within the virtual world of the game, which are governed by established scientific principles. Therefore, people are looking for the forms of computer simulation - training that require fewer organizational and logistic efforts. Among them, three-dimension virtual environment is the important part of this system in enhancing the learning process. This paper aims to design and implement 3D virtual labs, which are considered as a low-cost alternative to educators and students, in science E-learning.

Within a constructivists learning model with a multi perspective approach it is necessary for students to have an environment where they can perform scientific and technological experiments. Working in a science lab creates an interactive experience that encourages development and provides practical knowledge. Some cognitive processes arise through interaction; these play an important role in semantic construction. Usability within a platform refers to the interaction between the software and the users. This means the software will be easy to learn and navigate, allowing the user explore its potential through an attractive interface and operations. The software can be use efficiently, minimizing errors and increase user satisfaction, among others. This article focuses on studying the design and construction of a virtual laboratory through human interaction, to solve a problem through a virtual science lab.

This kind of execution is one of the requirements for Integrated Tokamak Modelling platform developed by the Nuclear Fusion community within the context of EUROFusion project [2]. The platform is unique and original: it entails the development of a comprehensive and completely generic tokamak simulator including both the physics and the machine, which can be applied for any fusion device. All components are linked inside work ows. This approach allows complex coupling of various algorithms while at the same time provides consistency. Work ows are composed of Kepler and Ptolemy II elements as well as set of the native libraries written in various languages (Fortran, C, C++). In addition to that, there are Python based components that are used for visualization of results as well as for pre/post processing. At the bottom of all these components there is a database layer that may vary between software releases, and require di erent version of access libraries. The community is using shared virtual research environment to prepare and execute work ows. All these constraints make running multiple Kepler sessions really challenging. However, ability to run numerous sessions in parallel is a must - to reduce computation time and to make it possible to run released codes while working with new software at the same time.

The Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab) is a novel, collaborative approach to compiling large-scale environmentally extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) models.The utility of the IELab product is greatly enhanced by avoiding the need to lock in an MRIO structure at the time the MRIO system is developed. The IELab advances the idea of the ""mother-daughter"" construction principle, whereby a regionally and sectorally very detailed ""mother"" table is set up, from which ""daughter"" tables are derived to suit specific research questions. By introducing a third tier - the ""root classification"" - IELab users are able to define their own mother-MRIO configuration, at no additional cost in terms of data handling. Customised mother-MRIOs can then be built, which maximise disaggregation in aspects that are useful to a family of research questions.The second innovation in the IELab system is to provide a highly automated collaborative research platform in a cloud-computing environment, greatly expediting workflows and making these computational benefits accessible to all users.Combining these two aspects realises many benefits. The collaborative nature of the IELab development project allows significant savings in resources. Timely deployment is possible by coupling automation procedures with the comprehensive input from multiple teams. User-defined MRIO tables, coupled with high performance computing, mean that MRIO analysis will be useful and accessible for a great many more research applications than would otherwise be possible.

Biol.,2020,Article,"Experiments with synthetic genetic logic circuits can be time-consuming and expensive. Accordingly, advances in the field of computer-aided design and simulation of genetic circuits have reduced the cost and time required for experimentation. D-VASim is the first genetic circuit simulation tool that allows users to interact with the model during run-time. In contrast to electronic circuits, genetic circuits have different threshold values for different circuits, which need to be estimated prior to simulation. D-VASim allows the user to perform threshold concentration and propagation delay analysis before simulating the circuit. The algorithm currently used in D-VASim has considerable scope for improvements. Thus, we propose a parallel implementation of the algorithm, significantly faster by up to 16 times. In adddition, we improve the algorithm for consistent runtimes across multiple simulation runs under the same parameter settings, reducing the worst-case standard deviation in runtime from 6.637 to 1.841. Our algorithm also estimates the threshold value more accurately, as evident from experimentation for long runtimes. With these modifications, the utility of D-VASim as a virtual laboratory environment has been significantly enhanced. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","genetic logic circuits, parallel programming LATEX, SBML, stochastic simulation, synthetic biology, threshold value analysis, timing analysis, virtual instrumentation",0,1,0,1

We developed a high-resolution hybridization-based genotype array coupled with an analysis workflow and database for the most speciose genus of coral, Acropora, and their symbionts. We designed the array to co-analyze host and symbionts based on bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers identified from genomic data of the two Caribbean Acropora species as well as their dominant dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium ‘fitti’. SNPs were selected to resolve multi-locus genotypes of host (called genets) and symbionts (called strains), distinguish host populations and determine ancestry of coral hybrids between Caribbean acroporids. Pacific acroporids can also be genotyped using a subset of the SNP loci and additional markers enable the detection of symbionts belonging to the genera Breviolum, Cladocopium, and Durusdinium. Analytic tools to produce multi-locus genotypes of hosts based on these SNP markers were combined in a workflow called the Standard Tools for Acroporid Genotyping (STAG). The STAG workflow and database are contained within a customized Galaxy environment (https://coralsnp.science.psu.edu/galaxy/), which allows for consistent identification of host genet and symbiont strains and serves as a template for the development of arrays for additional coral genera. STAG data can be used to track temporal and spatial changes of sampled genets necessary for restoration planning and can be applied to downstream genomic analyses. Using STAG, we uncover bi-directional hybridization between and population structure within Caribbean acroporids and detect a cryptic Acroporid species in the Pacific. © 2020, The Author(s).","Multidisciplinary, Article, bioinformatics, Genetic databases, data processing, Marine biology, Conservation biology, Ecological genetics, Restoration ecology, Acropora, biology.organism_classification, biology, SNP, Evolutionary biology, SNP genotyping, Genotype, Genotyping, Host (biology), Symbiodinium, Dinoflagellate, lcsh:Medicine, lcsh:R, lcsh:Science, lcsh:Q",1,0,0,1

The EPIC instrument on board the XMM-Newton observatory is the most powerful tool for studying variability even in faint sources. Each day, it collects a large amount of information about hundreds of new serendipitous sources, but the resulting huge (and growing) dataset is largely unexplored in the time domain. The project called Exploring the X-ray transient and variable sky (EXTraS) systematically extracted all temporal domain information in the XMM-Newton archive. This included a search and characterisation of variability, both periodic and aperiodic, in hundreds of thousands of sources spanning more than eight orders of magnitude in timescale and six orders of magnitude in flux, and a search for fast transients that were missed by standard image analysis. All results, products, and software tools have been released to the community in a public archive. A science gateway has also been implemented to allow users to run the EXTraS analysis remotely on recent XMM datasets. We give details on the new algorithms that were designed and implemented to perform all steps of EPIC data analysis, including data preparation, source and background modelling, generation of time series and power spectra, and search for and characterisation of different types of variabilities.

Design and methods: A pre-post comparison was applied. Students' design of experiments was rated in eight dimensions; namely, hypothesis forming and verification, selection of variables, initial conditions, device settings, materials and devices used, process and phenomena description. A three-level ranking scheme was employed for the evaluation of students' answers in each dimension. Results: A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a statistically significant difference between the students' pre- and post-test scores. Additional analysis by comparing the pre- and post-test scores using the Hake gain showed high gains in all but one dimension, which suggests that this improvement was almost inclusive.

The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end. This is a valuable instrument to track progresses towards environmental policies. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This allows us to study the spatial-temporal propagation of ultrafast pulses as well as the influence of high-order spectral phases such as group delay dispersion and third-order dispersion on pulse compression in time. The NLS can describe several nonlinear effects, in particular in this paper we consider the Kerr effect, cross-polarized wave generation and cubic-quintic propagation in order to highlight the potential of this equation combined with the GUIDE environment. Graphical user interfaces are commonly used in science and engineering teaching due to their educational value, and have proven to be an effective way to engage and motivate students.

Some students in this group may feel some degree of aversion towards these types of pure science-related subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc). In online learning scenarios, the average student is already an adult (37 years old or above) and may see no particular application of the aforementioned courses in their current or future professional life. Besides this, online institutions tend to lean too much on applet-based simulations. Although they may shed some light on the theory associated with the studied physical processes, these animated and interactive examples also seem to be ' stripped down' versions of the real events, and are felt to be disconnected from current scientific environments and engineering settings. For this reason, we describe a novel virtual lab approach to teach the basics of the low-energy interactions present in average x-ray settings. It combines real scientific simulation frameworks with modern computing techniques such as virtualization, cloud infrastructures, containers, networking and shared collaboration environments. It also fosters the use of hugely demanded development tools and programming languages and addresses the fundamentals of digital radiography and the linked electronic standards for image storage and transmission. With this mixed approach, blending scientific concepts, healthcare and state-of-the-art software solutions, our virtual labs have proven (over a period of five academic terms) to be both very attractive to and pedagogically successful (technically, and scientifically) for online engineering undergraduates. For the sake of completeness, we also propose a hands-on activity that mimics the geometrical peculiarities of x-ray rooms with the help of visible light and cheap materials. © 2019 European Physical Society.","cloud technologies, collaborative environments, containers, digital standards, online learning, virtual laboratory, x-ray physics",0,1,0,1

This paper presents the architecture of a geospatial OGC web service system as an integral part of a virtual research environment (VRE) general architecture for statistical processing and visualization of meteorological and climatic data. The architecture is a set of interconnected standalone SDI nodes with corresponding data storage systems. Each node runs a specialized software, such as a geoportal, cartographical web services (WMS/WFS), a metadata catalog, and a MySQL database of technical metadata describing geospatial datasets available for the node. It also contains geospatial data processing services (WPS) based on a modular computing backend realizing statistical processing functionality and, thus, providing analysis of large datasets with the results of visualization and export into files of standard formats (XML, binary, etc.). Some cartographical web services have been developed in a system's prototype to provide capabilities to work with raster and vector geospatial data based on OGC web services. The distributed architecture presented allows easy addition of new nodes, computing and data storage systems, and provides a solid computational infrastructure for regional climate change studies based on modern Web and GIS technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Geography, XML, computer.internet_protocol, computers, metadata, Geoportal, Node (computer science), Web service, computer.software_genre, data science, Spatial data infrastructure, Geospatial analysis, databases, visualization",0,0,1,1

Network security is the task of the Administrator, where the administrator is responsible for data security on the network. The problem that is often faced by a network administrator is the laboratory as a test site of network design that has been created without interrupting the running system. Testing laboratories are needed by the administrator as a test site for network design, before implementing the design on a real network system. In this research, the researchers propose a method to solve the problem of testing the computer network, through the approach of using virtual machine by creating virtual laboratory. This virtual laboratory allows an administrator to quickly reset the configuration without interrupting the system that has been running. The virtual laboratory is based on UML (User Mode Linux) virtualization technology using Netkit emulators. The researchers verified the experiment through a simulation based on firewall network security design trial scenarios that have been created using the Netkit emulator. The results of trials in a virtual laboratory show the similarity of the working environment to a real network system. It can be concluded that the Netkit emulator is able to run test scenarios and firewall commands on network security properly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","computer science, operating systems, computer.software_genre, computers, virtual laboratory, network security, business.industry, business",0,1,0,1

Many software tools have been developed to perform in silico analysis for this purpose, but none of them allow users to interact with the model during runtime. The runtime interaction gives the user a feeling of being in the lab performing a real world experiment. In this work, we present a user-friendly software tool named D-VASim (Dynamic Virtual Analyzer and Simulator), which provides a virtual laboratory environment to simulate and analyze the behavior of genetic logic circuit models represented in an SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). Hence, SBML models developed in other software environments can be analyzed and simulated in D-VASim. D-VASim offers deterministic as well as stochastic simulation; and differs from other software tools by being able to extract and validate the Boolean logic from the SBML model. D-VASim is also capable of analyzing the threshold value and propagation delay of a genetic circuit model. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

We introduce a generic method based on the microservice architecture, where software tools are encapsulated as Docker containers that can be connected into scientific workflows and executed using the Kubernetes container orchestrator. Results: We developed a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) which facilitates rapid integration of new tools and developing scalable and interoperable workflows for performing metabolomics data analysis. The environment can be launched on-demand on cloud resources and desktop computers. IT-expertise requirements on the user side are kept to a minimum, and workflows can be re-used effortlessly by any novice user. We validate our method in the field of metabolomics on two mass spectrometry, one nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and one fluxomics study. We showed that the method scales dynamically with increasing availability of computational resources. We demonstrated that the method facilitates interoperability using integration of the major software suites resulting in a turn-key workflow encompassing all steps for massspectrometry- based metabolomics including preprocessing, statistics and identification.

The article focuses on explaining the overall approach proposed for building the HuNI environment; it is not a detailed account of the technical aspects of HuNI's architecture, nor a report on the progress of the project. Instead, it discusses how HuNI is expected to differ from other approaches used to design digital resources and tools for the humanities, and how the complex research methods used by humanities researchers will be reflected in HuNI's design. HuNI intends to take a new approach to data aggregation and data-centred workflows for humanities research. This approach relies on an understanding of 'humanities data' as the various annotations, tags, links, associations, ratings, reviews, and comments produced during the humanities research process, together with the semantic 'entities' to which these annotations refer: concepts, persons, places, and events. A range of different data sets from various Australian providers are being ingested and transformed into Linked Data formats, and subsequently matched and aligned to a common ontology framework. A suite of virtual laboratory tools will also be deployed, enabling researchers to manipulate the aggregated data and to share their work. © The Author 2013.

Radiological studies and emergency laboratory test are of high importance for the management of hospital patients. However, it is known that during these events, they can generate significant bottlenecks. Appropriate request of such tests is of utmost importance to not generate delays in the patient flow. The aim of this paper is to describe a software designed to increase the realism of hospital-based MCI training through a realistic reproduction of radiology and laboratory departments. Methods In this paper, we present a Virtual Laboratory and Imaging system that we designed with the goal of increasing the realism of full-scale mass casualty simulations. The system is able to dynamically manage the speed and load of virtual departments while collecting data on usage and load, and provide data useful for the after-event debriefing. We tested this system in two pilot simulations involving, respectively, 105 and 89 simulated casualties. Results The system, by measuring the number of requests and exams' turnaround time, enabled an objective measurement of the laboratory and radiology workload during simulated MCIs. It was possible to identify bottlenecks and consequently use these data for after-action debriefing. Conclusion The tool not only increased the simulation realism by adding the radiology and laboratory departments but also provided valuable data that could be used for educational and organizational purposes. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Portal technologies and portal-based virtual research and learning environments (VREs and VLEs) already have become standard infrastructures within a large number of research communities and institutions. From 2004, a series of research and development projects began to ask the question whether an open source videoconferencing and collaboration system could be used as a complete, or as a part of, VRE. This study presents the evolution of these projects and at the same time, describes the definition of a VRE and their future possible integration. The OneVRE portlet integration project attempted to create missing components, including adding secure and universal identity management. This moves the idea of shared data to a different level by creating a new administrative domain that is outside the control of a single local institution portal and resolves certain administrative virtual organizations problems.

10.1108/10650741211253877,WebLab of a DC motor speed control didactical experiment,Campus-Wide Information Systems,2012,Article,"Purpose: Weblabs are an additional resource in the execution of experiments in control engineering education, making learning process more flexible both in time, by allowing extra class laboratory activities, and space, bringing the learning experience to remote locations where experimentation facilities would not be available. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and report on a weblab project where the speed of a DC motor is controlled in closed loop, being the control system parameters set by the remote user (student). Design/methodology/approach: The engine control experiments are run and on-line transmitted by videoconference over the internet, from a didactical plant physically located at the Systems and Automation Laboratory of the Control and Automation Engineering department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Parana. The system response (transient motor speed) to the user's choice of parameters is evaluated through performance indices (IAE, ITAE), which are used to qualify the ability of the student to tune PID and RTS control algorithms. There is an option to run experiments in open loop, so the student can perform preliminary analysis to identify the system dynamic model and then apply mathematical models and computational methods, learned in theoretical classes, to define best performance control parameters. A simulation function was implemented, to further help the student in the problem solution. Virtual instrumentation resources were used to implement the Weblab, using the DC motor of a laboratory didactical plant. A local server runs a LabVIEWTM application, which can be remotely accessed in the client side through a web browser, where the system front panel is reproduced. This remote interface is directly originated at the LabVIEWTM application, through an embedded web server. At the user request, the control of the remote system is granted. The user interface is cognitive, with motor speed, control signal, set point and all the pertinent information displayed in evolving charts and indicators. Microsoft™ Skype is used to establish a videoconference with the laboratory where the plant is located. Results of the user experiments are stored in local files, which can be e-mailed to the user at his command by the end of the session. Findings: Used as a platform in weblab projects, LabVIEW combined with Skype provides a suitable solution for the necessary software/hardware integration for communications with data acquisition systems and advanced connectivity resources. In virtual instrumentation Skype has proved to be efficient in establishing the right environment without the need for developing complex software for teaching practical control engineering concepts. Research limitations/implications: The level of performance (speed of acquisition, accuracy and number of parameters that could be evaluated) of the current system would need to be evaluated compared to some existing systems. The implication is the changes brought to the adopted approach to the development of, access to and the overall cost of producing virtual laboratory systems used for science, engineering and technology education. Practical implications: With further effort, the current and similar systems could be further upgraded with user login control and server, so that results can be submitted to the tutor, thus acting as a learning evaluation instrument.

10.1108/17504971311312627,Distance learning and skill acquisition in engineering sciences: Present state and prospects,Multicultural Education & Technology Journal,2013,Article,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an improved concept of software-based laboratory exercises, namely a Virtual Laboratory for Engineering Sciences (VLES). Design/methodology/approach: The implementation of distance learning and e-learning in engineering sciences (such as Mechanical and Electrical Engineering) is still far behind current practice in narrative disciplines (Economics, Management, etc.). This is because education in technical disciplines requires laboratory exercises, providing skill-acquisition and hands-on experience. In order to overcome this problem for distance-learning developers and practitioners, a new modular and hierarchically organized approach is needed. Findings: The concept involves simulation models to emulate system dynamics, full virtual reality to provide visualization, advanced social-clubbing to ensure proper communication, and an AI tutor to supervise the lab work. Its modularity and hierarchical organization offer the possibility of applying the concept to practically any engineering field: a higher level provides the general framework - it considers lab workplaces as objects regardless of the technical field they come from, and provides communication and supervision - while the lower level deals with particular workplaces. An improved student's motivation is expected. Originality/value: The proposed concept aims rather high, thus making the work truly challenging. With the current level of information and communication technologies, some of the required features can only be achieved with difficulty; however, the rapid growth of the relevant technologies supports the eventual practicality of the concept. This paper is not intended to present any final results, solutions, or experience. The idea is to promote the concept, identify problems, propose guidelines, and possibly open a discussion. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies, Computer software, distance learning, electrical engineering, Engineering disciplines, Laboratories, laboratory exercises, Mechanical engineering, online learning, Robots, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Design/methodology/approach: Usability testing was used to evaluate the usability of OJAX++ in relation to biology researchers. Interviews with biology researchers in a large Irish university were conducted to investigate their research information behaviour, to establish user requirements in their discipline and to evaluate the feasibility of using OJAX++ in their research. Findings: The results show that biology researchers used online tools extensively in their research but do not use social networking tools. E-mail and phone conversations are the preferred methods of collaborating with colleagues. The biology researchers found that OJAX++ was easy to use, intuitive and professionally presented but in its present format, OJAX++ does not fit in with current research practices as they do not use Web 2.0 tools that facilitate tagging. A list of requirements of a VRE for biology researchers is presented. Originality/value: The findings of the study will assist developers of VREs and other web tools to better understand how researchers, in particular biologists, collaborate during the research process and what they require from online research tools.

Engineering is transformed into a constructive joint effort within the framework of simulation and exploration. Engineers share information at a rapid pace, with the collective aim of increasing product, process and service quality and reducing development time and costs. The internet-based, virtual or tele-laboratory permits experimentation independently of distance, in a way similar to what occurs in conventional laboratories. With the latest technology available, it reaches the same objectives as for a hands-on or conventional research or university laboratory, and even more efficiently in most cases. The application properties now range right up to the internet-controlled visualization of processes far away from the platforms.

With the growing computational complexity of biology big data, advanced analytic systems, known as prescriptive systems, are being built using machine learning models to intelligently predict optimum computation solutions for users for better data analysis. However, lack of user-friendly prescriptive systems poses a critical roadblock to facilitating informed decision-making by users. In this paper, we detail a formative usability study to address the complexities faced by users while using prescriptive systems. Our usability research approach considers bioinformatics workflows and community cloud resources in the KBCommons framework's science gateway.

The solution was positively evaluated by the participants, but most of them indicated that it lacks support for laboratory activities. As it is well known that many of computer science subjects (e.g. Computer Networks, Information Security, Systems Administration, etc.) require a suitable and flexible environment where students can access a set of computers and network devices to successfully complete their hands-on activities. To achieve this criteria, we created a cloud-based virtual laboratory based on OpenStack cloud platform to facilitate access to virtual machine both locally and remotely. Cloud-based virtual labs bring a lot of advantages, such as increased manageability, scalability, high availability and flexibility, to name a few. This arrangement has been tested in a case-study exercise with a group of students as part of Computer Networks and System Administration courses at Kabul Polytechnic University in Afghanistan. To measure success, we introduced a level test to be completed by participants prior and after the experiment. As a result, the learners achieved an average of 17.1 % higher scores in the post level test after completing the practical exercises. Lastly, we distributed a questionnaire after the experiment and students provided positive feedback on the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed solution. © 2017 IEEE.","cloud computing, Experimental Evaluation, OpenStack, Virtual Computer Lab, virtualization",0,1,0,1

They are an effective way to meet the growing demand for education. MOOC platforms have been created around the world, such as Coursera, founded by Stanford University; edX, cofounded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University; and XUETANG, developed by Tsinghua University [1]-[3]. MOOC platforms provide students with more systematic learning opportunities than traditional teaching and possess obvious advantages in cost-effectiveness and time flexibility [4]. The Computer Control System (CCS) course at Northeastern University (NEU) in China is a MOOC launched on the iCourse website [5], and it is offered twice a year, with nearly 7000 participants in each session. The class format currently includes videos, online discussions, homework, and examinations; experiments matching the theory lectures are absent. This is a common problem in MOOCs: experimentation is neglected because of the lack of effective methods or tools using this new platform. The drawbacks of offline experiments, such as the lack of interaction among teacher and students and insufficient supervision [6], [7], also prevent their wide employment in MOOCs. As a result, the lack of experimental teaching in MOOCs causes great trouble to both teachers and students, weakens the effectiveness of courses, and prohibits teaching some experimental courses via MOOCs. Fortunately, with the rapid development of science and technology, the rise of cloud technology provides a new choice for laboratory construction. Virtualization technology based on cloud computing can radically solve existing problems, such as an excessive number of students or lack of experimental resources. In addition, the large-scale data-processing ability in the cloud computing environment also makes it possible for teachers and students to interact on the MOOC platform. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Digital control, cloud computing, computer-aided instruction, Solid modeling, Electronic learning, computational modeling, Real-time systems",0,1,0,1

While MSI data can be routinely collected, its broad application is currently limited by the lack of easily accessible analysis methods that can process data of the size, volume, diversity, and complexity generated by MSI experiments. The development and application of cutting-edge analytical methods is a core driver in MSI research for new scientific discoveries, medical diagnostics, and commercial-innovation.

Global physical input–output tables (gPIOTs) collate a vast array of information on the world economy's physical structure and its interdependence with the environment, which can help to monitor progress toward a sustainable circular economy. However, building gPIOTs requires dealing with mismatched and incomplete primary data with high uncertainties, which makes it a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor. We address this challenge by introducing the PIOLab: A virtual laboratory for building gPIOTs. This represents the newest branch of the industrial ecology virtual laboratory (IELab) concept, a cloud-computing platform and collaborative research environment through which participants can pool resources to assemble individual input–output tables that target specific research questions. To overcome the lack of primary data, the PIOLab builds extensively upon secondary data derived from a variety of models commonly used in industrial ecology. We use the case of global iron-steel supply chains to describe the architecture of the PIOLab and highlight its analytical capabilities. A major strength of the gPIOT is its ability to provide mass-balanced indicators on both apparent/direct and embodied/indirect flows, for regions and disaggregated economic sectors. We present the first gPIOTs for 10 years (2008–2017), covering 32 regions, 30 processes, and 39 types of iron/steel flows. Diagnostic tests of the data reconciliation show a good level of adherence between raw data and the values realized in the gPIOT.

However, the dearth of detailed empirical data and knowledge of the influences of global/regional forces on local land-use decisions is a substantial challenge to formulating multi-scale agent-based models (ABMs) of land change.

POM was applied to a simplified agent-based model of LUCC to design and test model relationships linking global market influence to agents' land-use decisions within an example test site. Results demonstrated that evaluating alternative model parameterizations based on their ability to simultaneously reproduce target patterns led to more realistic land-use outcomes.

Owing to the ubiquity of gas turbines in military use, graduating cadets will encounter a variety of these engines throughout their military careers. Especially for this unique population, it is important for engineering students to be familiar with the operation and applications of gas turbines. Experimental analysis of a functional auxiliary power unit (APU) from an Army utility helicopter has been a key component of this block of instruction for several decades. As with all laboratory equipment, the APU has experienced intermittent maintenance issues, which occasionally render it unusable for the gas turbine laboratory in the course. Because of this, a very basic virtual laboratory was implemented which integrated video of the physical laboratory with key parameters and behind-the-screen data collection for use in engine analysis. A revitalized version of both the physical and virtual gas turbine laboratory experiences offered in the thermal-fluids course will include substantial improvements over the existing setup. The physical laboratory, which is centered on a refurbished APU from a medium-sized commercial aircraft, will continue to incorporate measurements of temperature and pressure throughout the combustion process, as well as fuel flow rate. In an improvement over the original laboratory setup, an orifice plate will be used to measure the flow rate of bleed air exiting the turbine, which had not previously been open during engine testing. Additionally, the air flow through the anti-surge valve was not metered in the original version of the physical laboratory. However, the anti-surge air flow can account for nearly 25% of the total air flow, and performance calculations in the physical laboratory will now account for this loss. The turbine output shaft will run a water-brake dynamometer. All instrumentation will be converted to digital signals and projected on a large screen outside the test area through a LabVIEW front panel. The virtual laboratory will include the same metering options as the operational APU. In addition, the virtual laboratory will include the option to alter engine operating parameters, such as inlet temperature and pressure or exhaust temperatures, and students may conduct broad parameter sweeps across ranges of possible inputs or desired outputs. These improvements will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of gas turbine operation and capabilities in practical applications.

One possible solution for overcoming these shortcomings is to use a multi-player computer game engine for implementing interactive laboratory environments. Taking advantage of game technology, the students are enabled to simultaneously interact with laboratory equipment in the virtual laboratory and to communicate with each other through voice or chat. In particular, assembling the experimental equipment before using it in some experimental procedure can become part of the laboratory exercise. In this article, a virtual gear design laboratory environment for a junior-level undergraduate mechanical engineering course on mechanisms and machine dynamics is presented. This virtual laboratory environment implemented using a multiplayer computer game engine provides the students with the flexibility to perform various experiments related to the concepts of the fundamental law of gearing and to planetary motion of gears. In this environment, the students can work in teams to interactively select and cooperatively assemble gear train components piece by piece into a more complex experimental apparatus. This article describes the assembly logic that is used to combine individual components into experimental setups as part of the experimental procedure in student laboratories. Furthermore, the game environment can be equipped with functionality for monitoring the students' progress and learning outcomes, thus enabling skill-based assessment.

However, combining the advantages of both these approaches and integrating them into an effective learning environment has not been reported yet. One of the challenges in creating such a combination is to overcome the barriers between real and virtual systems, i.e. to select compatible platforms, to achieve an efficient mapping between the real world and the virtual environment and to arrange for efficient communications between the different system components. This paper will present a pilot implementation of a multi-player game-based virtual laboratory environment that is linked to the remote experimental setup of an air flow rig. This system is designed for a junior-level mechanical engineering laboratory on fluid mechanics. In order to integrate this remote laboratory setup into the virtual laboratory environment, an existing remote laboratory architecture had to be redesigned. The integrated virtual laboratory platform consists of two main parts, namely an actual physical experimental device controlled by a remote controller and a virtual laboratory environment that was implemented using the 'Source' game engine, which forms the basis of the commercially available computer game 'Half- Life 2' in conjunction with 'Garry's Mod' (GM). The system implemented involves a local device controller that exchanges data in the form of shared variables and Dynamical Link Library (DLL) files with the virtual laboratory environment, thus establishing the control of real physical experiments from inside the virtual laboratory environment. The application of a combination of C++ code, Lua scripts [ 1 ] and LabVIEW Virtual Instruments makes the platform very flexible and expandable. This paper will present the architecture of this platform and discuss the general benefits of virtual environments that are linked with real physical devices.

10.1115/IMECE2014-37149,An efficient method for creating virtual spaces for virtual reality,International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,2014,Conference Paper,"A virtual space (VS) is an indispensable component of a virtual environment (VE) in virtual reality (VR). Usually, it is created using general tools and skills that are independent of the users' specific applications and intents. Creating a VS by surveying the real world with traditional measuring tools or creating virtual features with CAD software involves many steps and thus is time consuming and complicated. This renders the construction of VEs difficult, impairs their flexibility and hampers their widespread usage. In this paper, an efficient method for creating VSs with a handheld camera is introduced. In this approach, the camera is used as a measuring tool that scans the real scene and obtains the corresponding surface information. This information is then used to generate a virtual 3D model through a series of data processing procedures. Firstly, the camera's pose is traced in order to locate the points of the scene's surface, whereby these surface points form a point cloud. Then, this point cloud is meshed and the mesh elements are textured automatically one by one. Unfortunately, the virtual 3D model resulting from this procedure represents an impenetrable solid and thus collision detection would prevent the avatars from entering into this VS. Therefore, an approach for eliminating this restriction is proposed here. Finally, a game-based virtual laboratory (GBVL) for an undergraduate mechanical engineering class was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

10.1115/IMECE2014-38606,A platform for mechanical assembly education using the Microsoft Kinect,International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,2014,Conference Paper,"Mechanical assembly activities involve multiple factors including humans, mechanical parts, tools and assembly environments. In order to simulate assembly processes by computers for educational purposes, all these factors should be considered. Virtual reality (VR) technology, which aims to integrate natural human motion into real-world scenarios, provides an ideal simulation medium. Novel VR devices such as 3D glasses, motion-tracking gloves, haptic sensors, etc. are able to fulfill fundamental assembly simulation needs. However, most of these implementations focus on assembly simulations for computer-aided design, which are geared toward professionals rather than students, thus leading to complicated assembly procedures not suitable for students. Furthermore, the costs of these novel VR devices and specifically designed VR platforms represent an untenable financial burden for most educational institutions. In this paper, a virtual platform for mechanical assembly education based on the Microsoft Kinect sensor and Garry's Mod (GMod) is presented. With the help of the Kinect's body tracking function and voice recognition technology in conjunction with the graphics and physics simulation capabilities of GMod, a low-cost VR platform that enables educators to author their own assembly simulations was implemented. This platform utilizes the Kinect as the sole input device. Students can use voice commands to navigate their avatars inside of a GMod powered virtual laboratory as well as use their body's motions to integrate pre-defined mechanical parts into assemblies. Under this platform, assembly procedures involving the picking, placing and attaching of parts can be performed collaboratively by multiple users. In addition, the platform allows collaborative learning without the need for the learners to be co-located. A pilot study for this platform showed that, with the instructor's assistance, mechanical engineering undergraduate students are able to complete basic assembly operations.

To solve this problem for the WIYN Observatory One Degree Imager (ODI), we developed the ODI-Portal, Pipeline, and Archive (ODI-PPA) science gateway, integrating the data archive, data reduction pipelines, and a user portal. In this paper, we discuss the integration of the QuickReduce (QR) pipeline into PPA's Tier 2 processing framework. QR is a set of parallelized, stand-alone Python routines accessible to all users, and operators who can create master calibration products and produce standardized calibrated data, with a short turn-around time. Upon completion, the data are ingested into the archive and portal, and made available to authorized users. Quality metrics and diagnostic plots are generated and presented via the portal for operator approval and user perusal. Additionally, users can tailor the calibration process to their specific science objective(s) by selecting custom datasets, applying preferred master calibrations or generating their own, and selecting pipeline options. Submission of a QuickReduce job initiates data staging, pipeline execution, and ingestion of output data products all while allowing the user to monitor the process status, and to download or further process/analyze the output within the portal. User-generated data products are placed into a private user-space within the portal.

However, data processing is only a small part of the Big Data challenge. Efficient knowledge discovery and scientific advancement in the Big Data era requires new and equally efficient tools: modern user interfaces for searching, identifying and viewing data online without direct access to the data; tracking of data provenance; searching, plotting and analyzing metadata; interactive visual analysis, especially of (time-dependent) image data; and the ability to execute pipelines on supercomputing and cloud resources with minimal user overhead or expertise even to novice computing users. The Trident project at Indiana University offers a comprehensive web and cloud-based microservice software suite that enables the straight forward deployment of highly customized Scalable Compute Archive (SCA) systems; including extensive visualization and analysis capabilities, with minimal amount of additional coding. Trident seamlessly scales up or down in terms of data volumes and computational needs, and allows feature sets within a web user interface to be quickly adapted to meet individual project requirements. Domain experts only have to provide code or business logic about handling/visualizing their domain's data products and about executing their pipelines and application work flows. Trident's microservices architecture is made up of light-weight services connected by a REST API and/or a message bus; a web interface elements are built using NodeJS, AngularJS, and HighCharts JavaScript libraries among others while backend services are written in NodeJS, PHP/Zend, and Python. The software suite currently consists of (1) a simple work flow execution framework to integrate, deploy, and execute pipelines and applications (2) a progress service to monitor work flows and sub-work flows (3) ImageX, an interactive image visualization service (3) an authentication and authorization service (4) a data service that handles archival, staging and serving of data products, and (5) a notification service that serves statistical collation and reporting needs of various projects. Several other additional components are under development. Trident is an umbrella project, that evolved from the One Degree Imager, Portal, Pipeline, and Archive (ODI-PPA) project which we had initially refactored toward (1) a powerful analysis/visualization portal for Globular Cluster System (GCS) survey data collected by IU researchers, 2) a data search and download portal for the IU Electron Microscopy Center's data (EMC-SCA), 3) a prototype archive for the Ludwig Maximilian University's Wide Field Imager. The new Trident software has been used to deploy (1) a metadata quality control and analytics portal (RADY-SCA) for DICOM formatted medical imaging data produced by the IU Radiology Center, 2) Several prototype work flows for different domains, 3) a snapshot tool within IU's Karst Desktop environment, 4) a limited component-set to serve GIS data within the IU GIS web portal.

Current workforce training methods require expensive state-of-the-art laboratory equipment, as well as commercial licenses for photonic design software, which can be prohibitively costly for many universities. Virtual laboratories and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can help fill this training gap by providing a scalable approach to photonics workforce education for an international audience. In this project, AIM Photonics Academy-the education initiative of AIM Photonics, a Manufacturing USA Institute-is creating a virtual laboratory to enable self-directed learning for the emerging photonics workforce. Students learn photonic device and circuit modeling in a 3D online virtual lab environment with interactive simulations of micron-scale photonic visualizations. An intuitive interface highlights the most critical device design parameters and their optimal operational settings for applications in Datacom, wireless communication, sensing, and imaging. Simulations include silicon waveguide propagation and loss, radial waveguide bends, and directional couplers for photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In spring of 2019, AIM Academy has integrated these simulations into an online course focused on PIC-chip design, with a fundamentals course expected in fall of 2019. Additionally, these online tools will be used in a blended learning curriculum in 2020 to train engineers and technicians in semiconductor design, testing and packaging for photonics applications.

An efficient technology of deferred synthesis of stereo clips is proposed. It allows one to create stereo clips without interfering with real-time visualization. The technology includes real-time construction of visualization scenario and offline transformation of the scenario into a stereo clip. Methods for implementing these stages for the task of stereo visualization of the saturation isosurface of displacing fluid are considered. For this purpose, a special file format «scr» for the visualization scenario is developed on the basis of chunk data structures. This format provides a compact representation of neighboring repeated frames. The scenario file is transformed into a sequence of 4K stereo pairs by means of the offscreen rendering technology of the virtual scene, and stereo pairs are added to the stereo clip using a number of open-source FFmpeg libraries designed for processing digital video content. The generated stereo clip is placed within an MP4 container, and the video compressing standard H.264 is used. The proposed technologies and methods of 4K stereo clip deferred synthesis are implemented in a software designed for visualizing simulation results of the unstable displacement of oil from porous media. Using this software, a 4K stereo clip is created, which illustrates the evolution of the saturation isosurface during the process of unstable oil displacement. Testing confirmed the validity of the solution. The software can be used in virtual laboratories, for designing virtual environment systems and scientific visualization systems, in educational applications etc. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","4k, software, lcsh:Electronic computers.

This virtual laboratory method is then compared with two other commonly used synchronous usability test methods: the traditional lab approach and WebEx, a web-based conferencing and screen sharing approach. A study was conducted with 48 participants in total, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators. The test participants completed 5 tasks on a simulated e-commerce website. The three methodologies were compared with respect to the following dependent variables: the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified; the severity of these usability defects; and the subjective ratings from NASA-TLX, presence and post-test subjective questionnaires. The three methodologies agreed closely in terms of the total number defects identified, number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks. However, there was a significant difference in the workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators, with the traditional lab condition imposing the least and the virtual lab and the WebEx conditions imposing similar levels. It was also found that the test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual world condition than the WebEx condition. These ratings were not significantly different from those in the traditional lab condition. The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach as an alternative to the conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing.

However, with the deployment of multiple disconnected Grid environments, we are now faced with the problem of interoperable access to resources from multiple environments to meet the requirements of scientific applications. Within the U. S. cyberinfrastructure environments, two key elements: both the National Science Foundation TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid (OSG) provide varied but important capabilities and resources needed by diverse computational communities. Hence, it is critical to understand how these communities can benefit from bridging these different environments and utilize them when needed. In this paper we present a novel approach to interoperable access to both OSG and TeraGrid to users through the CyberGIS Gateway - an online geographic information system. In particular, five key interoperability themes are addressed: authentication and authorization, information services, data management, and computation management and auditing.

Gateway development typically spans the duration of a particular grant, with the first production runs occurring some months after the award and concluding near the end of the project. Scientists use gateways as a means to interface with large resources. Our gateway infrastructure facilitates this by hiding away the various details of the underlying resources and presents an intuitive way to interact with the resource. In this paper, we present our work on GPSI, a general-purpose science gateway infrastructure that can be easily customized to meet the needs of an application. This reduces the time to deployment and improves scientific productivity.

Many of these jobs are compute-intensive runs that benefit from submission to clusters at Purdue, TeraGrid, and Open Science Grid (OSG). Most of the nanoHUB users are not computational experts but end-users who expect complete and uninterrupted service. Within the ecology of grid computing resources, we need to manage the grid submissions of these users transparently with the highest possible degree of user satisfaction. In order to best utilize grid computing resources, we have developed a grid probe protocol to test the job submission system from end to end. Beginning in January 2009, we have collected a total of 1.2 million probe results from job submissions to TeraGrid, OSG, Purdue, and nanoHUB compute clusters. We then utilized these results to intelligently submit jobs to various grid sites using a model for probability of success based in part on probe test history.

This paper argues that VREs in combination with Semantic Web technologies offer a range of possibilities to align research with library practices. This main claim of the article is exemplified by a metadata integration process of bibliographic data from libraries to a VRE which is based on Semantic MediaWiki. The integration process rests on three pillars: MediaWiki as a web-based repository, Semantic MediaWiki annotation mechanisms, and semi-automatic workflow management for the integration of digital resources. Thereby, needs of scholarly research practices and capacities for interactions are taken into account. The integration process is part of the design of Semantic MediaWiki for Collaborative Corpora Analysis (SMW-CorA) which uses a concrete research project in the history of education as a reference point for an infrastructural distribution.

Since its release in December 2009, there has been a sustained, near-linear growth in the rate of CSG use, both in terms of number of users submitting jobs each month and number of jobs submitted. The average amount of computational time used per month by CSG increased more than 5-fold since its initial release. As of April 2012, more than 4,000 unique users have run parallel tree inference jobs on TeraGrid/XSEDE resources using the CSG. The steady growth in resource use suggests that the CSG is meeting an important need for computational resources in the Systematics/Evolutionary Biology community. To ensure that XSEDE resources accessed through the CSG are used effectively, policies for resource consumption were developed, and an advanced set of management tools was implemented. Studies of usage trends show that these new management tools helped in distributing XSEDE resources across a large user population that has low-to-moderate computational needs. In the first quarter of 2012, 30% of all active XSEDE users accessed computational resources through the CSG, while the analyses conducted by these users accounted for 0.7% of all allocable XSEDE computational resources. User survey results showed that the easy access to XSEDE/TeraGrid resources through the CSG had a critical and measurable scientific impact: at least 300 scholarly publications spanning all major groups within the Tree of Life have been enabled by the CSG since 2009.

The CIPRES Science Gateway (CSG) was designed to meet this need by providing browser-based access to phylogenetic codes run on XSEDE compute resources. The CSG has lowered the barrier for access to HPC resources for biologists worldwide, supporting more than 6,100 users and enabling more than 600 publications over the past three years. Here we describe plans to create a new set of public CSG web services that can be accessed by any developer through a programmatic interface. These services will allow us to embed access to XSEDE resources within well-established phylogenetics software packages, thus leveraging the investments by developers in creating these rich work environments and by users in learning to use them. The services will also allow any developer with modest scripting skills to access and use CSG capabilities outside of the current browser interface. Our goal in creating these services is to allow scientists to conduct analyses without leaving their preferred work environment, whether that is a complex desktop application, a set of ad hoc scripted workflows, or the existing CSG browser interface. This paper describes the architectural design of the CSG web services, identifies potential issues that will be addressed in exposing programmatic access to HPC resources, and describes plans to embed the CSG web services in eight popular community applications. © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.","CIPRES, phylogenetics, Representational state transfer, tree inference, web services",1,0,0,1

Science gateways, which serve as portals to scientific applications, have also evolved as researchers are dealing with rapidly expanding scientific datasets and the increasingly complex workflows. More and more gateways are being developed to support integrated services for running data-driven applications on HPC resources such as those on XSEDE. To facilitate this type of workflow, there is a pressing need for web-based data management systems that are easy to use, support data upload, sharing, access and management, and can be integrated with advanced computation and storage resources. More importantly such systems need to be accessible by users from the broad research and education communities. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of iData, a web-based community data publishing and sharing system. iData supports both generic file-based data collections and several commonly used environmental data collection formats including time series, GIS vector and raster data. Integrated data processing, visualization and filtering capabilities are provided for these data formats. Currently iData can be downloaded and deployed in a HUBzero-based gateway, and we plan to make it available for non-HUBzero platforms in the future. We present two examples in which iData has been successfully used to support research collaboration in driNET and GEOSHARE projects. © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.","Community data, Data publishing, data sharing, geospatial data, HUBzero, Science gateway data management, XSEDE",1,0,0,1

Science Gateways that integrate multiple resources can use predictions of queue wait times and run times to advice users when they choose where a job is executed or in an automated resource selection process. These predictions are also critical in executing workflows were it isn't feasible to have users specify where each task executes and the workflow management system therefore has to perform resource selection programmatically.

There is a growing interest in the exploitation and development of SGs. However, it remains challenging to understand and design SG with the required properties because of the complex nature of SGs. Additionally, it is difficult to decide upon frameworks that can be used to build them. In this paper we propose the Science Gateway Canvas, a business reference model for SGs that embodies the common SG functions and their organization into groups and categories. We used the Science Gateway Canvas for a systematic analysis and comparison of the functions offered by a selection of available frameworks that are used to build SGs. This illustrated the applicability of the Science Gateway Canvas as a comprehensive and generic reference model for understanding SGs.

10.1145/2753524.2753529,Apache airavata as a laboratory: Architecture and case study for component-based gateway middleware,Conference on Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment,2015,Conference Paper,"Science gateways are more than user interfaces to computational grids and clouds. Gateways are middleware in their own right, providing flexible, lightweight federations of heterogenous collections of computing resources (such as campus clusters, supercomputers, computational clouds), all of which remain challenges for many alternative middleware approaches. Gateways also are notable for providing science application-centric interfaces to computing resources rather than resource-centric views. An important challenge for science gateway research is to generalize specific science gateway strategies, defining a reference architecture that emcompasses major gateway capabilities while enabling implementation flexibility. Such a reference architecture should also enable ""platform as a service"" approaches that provide hosted versions of common gateway capabilities. In this paper, we summarize the Apache Airavata software system as a candidate reference architecture for science gateways. We propose the use of a component-based architecture to encompass major gateway capabilities (such as metadata management, meta-scheduling, execution management, and messaging). We examine the messaging system component in this abstract architecture in detail and describe its reimplementation and validation using third party messaging system software to replace a custom-built messaging system. Besides the operational validation of this specific component, we infer a preliminary validation of the overall architecture. The flexibility of component implementations within an overall architecture is essential as it allows gateway middleware to be the subject of distributed computing research for its own sake while also ensuring that we don't get locked into less than optimal implementations for gateway operations.

Gateways provide the services and tools users require to enable their scientific exploration, which in-cludes tasks such as running computer simulations or per-forming data analysis. Historically gateways have been con-structed to support the workflow of individual users, but collaboration between users has become an increasingly im-portant part of the discovery process. This trend has created a driving need for gateways to support data sharing between users. For example, a chemistry research group may want to run simulations collaboratively, analyze experimental data or tune parameter studies based on simulation output gen-erated by peers, whether as a default capability, or through explicit creation of sharing privileges. As another example, students in a classroom setting may be required to share their simulation output or data analysis results with the in-structor. However most existing gateways (including the pop-ularly used XSEDE gateways SEAGrid, Ultrascan, CIPRES, and NSG), do not support direct data sharing, so users have to handle these collaborations outside the gateway environ-ment. Given the importance of collaboration in current scien-tific practice, user collaboration should be a prime consider-ation in building science gateways.

These tools include automatic parcellation of brain images into labeled regions, described by dense 3D arrays; and shape analysis of regions described by triangulated sur-faces, for hypothesis testing in specific populations. We have developed mapping techniques that combine the benefits of working with triangulated surfaces with those of working with dense images, and have been working toward uniting these two tools: To automatically perform shape analysis on each segmented subcortical structure simultaneously. In this work we investigate the performance of our algo-rithm across a wide range of input data, examining the effect of number of voxels in 3D images, number of vertices in tri-Angulated surfaces, and number of structures being mapped onto simultaneously. Further, we investigate the performance of our OpenCL code implemented in two different environ-ments: The Intel OpenCL environment on a CPU, and the CUDA OpenCL environment on a GPU. We identify a range of inputs, generally smaller datasets, for which the CPU out performs the GPU. Finally we show the feasibility of mapping onto all the human gray matter sub-cortical structures simultaneously, and discuss our strategy. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Computational anatomy, Dif-feomorphometry, GPU, Neuroimaging, OpenCL, science gateways",1,0,0,1

Instrumentation and software improvements have allowed for the full realization of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a tool capable of determining atomic structures of protein and macromolecular samples. These advances open the door to solving new structures that were previously unattainable, which will soon make cryo-EM a ubiquitous tool for structural biology worldwide, serving both academic and commercial purposes. However, despite its power, new users to cryo-EM face significant obstacles. One major barrier consists of the handling of large datasets (10+ terabytes), where new cryo-EM users must learn how to interface with the Linux command line while also dealing with managing and submitting jobs to high performance computing resources. To address this barrier, we are developing the COSMIC2 Science Gateway as an easy, web-based, science gateway to simplify cryo-EM data analysis using a standardized workflow. Specifically, we have adapted the successful and mature Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES) Workbench [8] and integrated Globus Auth [6] and Globus Transfer [7] to enable federated user identity management and large dataset transfers to Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment's (XSEDE) [1] high performance computing (HPC) systems. With the support of XSEDE's Extended Collaborative Support Services (ECSS) [16] and the Science Gateway Community Institute's (SGCI) Extended Developer Support (EDS), this gateway will lower the barrier to high performance computing tools and facilitate the growth of cryo-EM to become a routine tool for structural biology. © 2017 ACM.","CIPRES, Cryo-electron microscopy, Globus, science gateways, SGCI EDS, XSEDE ECSS",1,0,0,1

In the last two years, in addition to computational neuroscientists, cognitive and experimental neuroscientists are also using NSG. Currently NSG has over 600 registered users and it is steadily growing. Users can access NSG via a web portal and via RESTful programmatic access. A particular usage mode of programmatic access to NSG enables users of community neuroscience projects such as the Open Source Brain, research projects within the European Human Brain Project and others to access HPC resources via NSG without having to obtain their own accounts on NSG. Based on demand and usage, over the last five years we have successfully acquired increasingly larger allocations (millions to ~ten million core hours) on resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program via the competitive peer review process.

Processing and modeling large amounts of sequencing data can be computationally intractable for desktop computing platforms. High performance computing (HPC) resources offer advantages in terms of computing power, and can be a general solution to these problems. Using HPCs directly for computational needs requires skilled users who know their way around HPCs and acquiring such skills take time. Science gateways acts as the middle layer between users and HPCs, providing users with the resources to accomplish compute-intensive tasks without requiring specialized expertise. We developed a web-based computing platform for genome biologists by customizing the PHP Gateway for Airavata (PGA) framework that accesses publicly accessible HPC resources via Apache Airavata.

The front-end application enables users to create patient-specific anatomic models from imaging data, generate finite-element meshes, prescribe boundary conditions, and set up an analysis. The finite-element based blood flow solver utilizes MPI and is massively scalable. SimVascular has been successfully integrated into graduate level courses on cardiovascular modeling at multiple institutions including Stanford, UC Berkeley, Purdue, and Marquette to introduce state-of-the-art modeling to the students and provide a basis for hands-on projects. While the front-end application can be installed and run on a laptop, the flow solver requires high performance computing (HPC) for realistic problem sizes.

The researchers analyze large amounts of data using the compute resources and the generated results, usually files are saved in the storage. Consider a scenario where a researcher has large output data files of historically run experiments on an external server. If the researcher wants to move the data to the gateway storage, then the only way to do it is through data transfer. This task would be cumbersome and time consuming. The paper discusses an approach through which historic or any data existing on a different server or in a cloud storage (Google Drive) or in an object storage (Amazon S3) can be ingested into the existing gateway without actually transferring it to the server. We discuss about a software called NextCloud and how it can be used as a gateway storage by integrating it with Apache Airavata. Airavata currently uses local file storage to store user related data files. On the client side, Airavata clients use different protocols like HTTP and SFTP for file transfer. NextCloud is an open source file share and communication platform that provides a common file access layer through its universal file access to different data sources. Integrating NextCloud with Airavata could solve the problem of providing unified file transfer API across all the Airavata clients.

ChIP-based NGS technologies, e.g. ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo, are widely used to detect the binding sites of DNA-interacting proteins in the genome and help us to have a deeper mechanistic understanding of genomic regulation. As sequencing data is generated at an unprecedented pace from the ChIP-based NGS pipelines, there is an urgent need for a metadata management system. To meet this need, we developed the Platform for Eukaryotic Genomic Regulation (PEGR), a web service platform that logs metadata for samples and sequencing experiments, manages the data processing workflows, and provides reporting and visualization. PEGR links together people, samples, protocols, DNA sequencers and bioinformatics computation. With the help of PEGR, scientists can have a more integrated understanding of the sequencing data and better understand the scientific mechanisms of genomic regulation.

10.1145/3311790.3396628,Building Science Gateways for Humanities,Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing,2020,Conference Paper,"Building science gateways for humanities content poses new challenges to the science gateway community. Compared with science gateways devoted to scientific content, humanities-related projects usually require 1) processing data in various formats, such as text, image, video, etc., 2) constant public access from a broad audience, and therefore 3) reliable security, ideally with low maintenance. Many traditional science gateways are monolithic in design, which makes them easier to write, but they can be computationally inefficient when integrated with numerous scientific packages for data capture and pipeline processing. Since these packages tend to be single-threaded or nonmodular, they can create traffic bottlenecks when processing large numbers of requests. Moreover, these science gateways are usually challenging to resume development on due to long gaps between funding periods and the aging of the integrated scientific packages. In this paper, we study the problem of building science gateways for humanities projects by developing a service-based architecture, and present two such science gateways: the Moving Image Research Collections (MIRC) - a science gateway focusing on image analysis for digital surrogates of historical motion picture film, and SnowVision - a science gateway for studying pottery fragments in southeastern North America. For each science gateway, we present an overview of the background of the projects, and some unique challenges in their design and implementation. These two science gateways are deployed on XSEDE's Jetstream academic clouding computing resource and are accessed through web interfaces.

Most science gateways provide common capabilities including data management and sharing, scientific code development, high performance computing (HPC) integration, and scientific workflow execution of varying automation. Despite the availability of scientific workflow frameworks such as Pegasus and workflow definition languages such as the Common Workflow Language (CWL), in practice typical workflows on science gateways still involve a mix of non-reusable code, desktop tools, and intermediate data wrangling. With the growing emphasis on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) science, such mixed workflows present a significant challenge to ensuring compliance to these principles. These challenges are further compounded in the earth sciences where researchers spend inordinate amounts of time manually acquiring, wrangling, and processing earth observation data from repositories managed by organizations such as NASA, USGS, etc. Our extensible geospatial data framework, GeoEDF is designed to address these challenges, making remote datasets directly usable in computational code and facilitating earth science workflows that execute entirely in a science gateway.

However, without sufficient annotation of the methods used to collect and analyze the data, the ability to reproduce and reuse those products suffers. This lack of assurance of the quality and credibility of the data at the different stages in the research process essentially wastes much of the investment of time and funding and fails to drive research forward to the level of potential possible if everything was effectively annotated and disseminated to the wider research community. In order to address this issue for the Hawai'i Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) project, a water science gateway was developed at the University of Hawaiĝ€i (UH), called the ĝ€ike Wai Gateway. In Hawaiian, ĝ€ike means knowledge and Wai means water. The gateway supports research in hydrology and water management by providing tools to address questions of water sustainability in Hawaiĝ€i. The gateway provides a framework for data acquisition, analysis, model integration, and display of data products. The gateway is intended to complement and integrate with the capabilities of the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science's (CUAHSI) Hydroshare by providing sound data and metadata management capabilities for multi-domain field observations, analytical lab actions, and modeling outputs. Functionality provided by the gateway is supported by a subset of the CUAHSI's Observations Data Model (ODM) delivered as centralized web based user interfaces and APIs supporting multi-domain data management, computation, analysis, and visualization tools to support reproducible science, modeling, data discovery, and decision support for the Hawai'i EPSCoR ĝ€ike Wai research team and wider Hawaiĝ€i hydrology community.

Here, we present recent advances in both the platform's capabilities and in its adoption for additional software suites and new possibilities for further development. The past year has seen substantial progress, with the addition of two new software suites and additional authors. A very successful workshop, supported by the MOLSSI, NSF, and NIST, was held at NIST from Dec 11-13, 2019. The agenda contained discussions of the science as well as demonstrations of the codes both in production and learning modes. More than 30 scientists participated in the workshop. Over the past few months, the number of registered gateway users has grown to over 60. The applications being deployed provide users with a number of state-of-the-art computational techniques to treat electron scattering from atomic and molecular targets, as well as the interaction of radiation with such systems. One may view all of these approaches as generalized close-coupling methods, where the inclusion of electron correlation is accomplished via the addition of generalized pseudostates. A number of the methods can also be employed to compute high-quality bound-state wave functions by closing the channels and imposing exponentially decaying boundary conditions. The application software suites are deployed on a number of NSF and DoE supercomputing systems.

In recent years, in addition to computational neuroscientists, growing numbers of experimentalists such as cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists, biomedical researchers, physicists and electrical engineers are increasingly interested in using NSG for their neuroscience data processing and analysis needs.

The existence of a science gateway eliminates the user’s need to learn to work with HPC systems and to manage software installations and updates. With well-designed user interfaces, users can more quickly become effective users of scientific applications and can manage information needed for replicating, modifying, and sharing results. All of these efficiency gains enable users to focus more on their research. In addition, science gateways are being identified as an effective educational tool, a tool to be used in classroom environments as a method to get students quickly into research on domain specific questions. In the absence of a science gateway, students are likely to need a considerable time to learn to work with HPC systems, and any time spent on such will reduce their time on the actual science.

To address this challenge, IoT middleware platforms have been proposed to abstract away the specificities of such devices, promoting interoperability among them, and easing application development. One of these proposals is FIWARE, an open, generic platform developed in the European Community to leverage the development of Future Internet applications. Given a set of FIWARE components required for a specific application under development, their deployment and configuration can be made either manually or using a container-based approach. However, setting up an environment composed by the main FIWARE components might sometimes not be a trivial process. This paper introduces FIWARE-Lab@RNP, a Web virtual laboratory for prototyping and experimenting applications based on the FIWARE platform. The main concern of FIWARE-Lab@RNP is enabling the use of FIWARE resources through the Internet in a transparent way, thus relieving users from the need of deploying and operating a FIWARE instance on their development or owned environment. The virtual laboratory provides functionalities for easily creating, configuring, and managing instances of FIWARE components, devices, context entities, and services while attempting to minimize the learning curve regarding these tasks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

10.1145/3395245.3396408,Implementation of a Virtual Laboratory of Industrial Robots,International Conference on Information and Education Technology,2020,Conference Paper,"This article shares the results obtained about the implementation of a Virtual Laboratory (VL) of industrial robots in the class of Integrated Manufacturing Systems. The reasons to implement it were: (1) to use different configurations of industrial robots, (2) to decrease the use of a real laboratory with expensive equipment, (3) to avoid accidents and misuse of equipment, (4) to use a robot for each student, and (5) to know the perception of engineering students, about using a VL in their course. The novelty of this work is that VL is based on the use of a mechanism simulation module of a CAD program (Computer-aided design). On the other hand, its implementation can be replicated with any other program of this type. Other industrial robot simulators are based on a single type of robot, which is sometimes experimental or didactic. In this case, the simulator presented uses three industrial robots of the ABB company. Because the VL is based on a CAD program application, its cost is less than a sophisticated program aimed at programming industrial robots; professors can also vary the level or depth of the knowledge they want to teach. It can be used for an introductory course or an advanced robotics course according to the equations that are programmed. Another advantage is that the simulator allows a new type of robot to be incorporated to have a greater variety of configurations without the need to write some type of computer code. By using a CAD program, users can print the robot models in 3D or apply engineering analysis to determine mechanical stresses in their components, which allows endless academic activities for students. In addition, if a path is defined within the VL, a program can be generated for a real robot to follow that path. © 2020 ACM.","educational innovation, higher education, industrial robots, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Similarly, in higher education, programs are redefined to allow students to gain communicative and cooperative competences to qualify them for their professional work and the role they will play in society, however, there is a lack of specific guidelines on learning strategies and tools that promote acquisition and development of these competences. An empirical study is shown to examine how an online learning environment developed from scratch throughout several years and based on web-based resources such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, educational videos, and a game-based learning methodology combines with active learning, which might impact the student's relationships and cooperative competence development. As a result, a case study was carried out through a virtual learning environment. It was created to motivate and to facilitate students' involvement. The analysis was conducted based on the data collected from a core subject of the Computer Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. The answers of an online survey (n=289) were examined by using the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results obtained show that the use of this learning environment have a significant and positive impact on the two dimensions of relational coordination; communication and relationships. Furthermore, the learning environment plays a key role in the acquisition and development of cooperative competence.

This interoperability issue leads to myriad problems: inability to bring multiple heterogeneous specialized resources together to solve problems where different resources are optimized for different facets of the problem; inability to choose from multiple resources on-the-fly as needed based on characteristics and available capacity; and ultimately a less than optimal application of nationally-funded resources toward advancing science. This paper presents version 1.0 of the Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) Resource Description Specification - a schema providing a common language for describing storage and computing resources utilized by science gateway technologies - as well as an Inventory API and software development kits for incorporating resource definitions into gateway projects. We discuss multiple gateway integration design options, with trade offs regarding robustness and availability. We detail the adoption to date of the SGCI Resource Specification by several prominent projects, including Apache Airavata, HUBzero®, Open OnDemand, Tapis, and XSEDE the XSEDE adoption is worth highlighting explicitly as it has led to a new API within the XSEDE Information Services architecture which provides SGCI resource descriptions of all active XSEDE resources. Additionally, we show how the use of the SGCI Resource Specification provides interoperability across resource providers and projects that adopt it.

Firstly, the study reviews the general concept and algorithm of synchronous generator model. Secondly, the simulation method of this system is discussed. Finally, the paper introduces its example and analysis. One of the major objectives of this project is the dynamics of synchronous generators connected to the 500 kV EHV Jamali (Jawa-Madura-Bali) System under unbalanced steady state condition that could be modeled as a balanced synchronous generator's model with unbalanced voltage inputs. The balanced synchronous generator model based on the rotor's qd0 reference frame was chosen to substitute generator's model embeded in loadflow analysis. The verification of the proposed generator's model was checked by comparing it with a PSS Tecquiment NE9070 simulator. The unbalanced voltage inputs of generator were derived utilizing the loadflow analysis by determining the phase and sequence currents, and average bus voltages of the 500 kV EHV Jamali grid considering unbalanced portion variations. Meanwhile, the load locations having significant effect on the test generators are obtained by using the electricity tracing method.

In India, educational activities during the middle of the semester were affected due to lockdown related to COVID-19. However, the theory classes were conducted online, and educational institutions are finding it difficult to complete the laboratory experiments due to closure of colleges for the students due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The exponential growth of data generated in biology research, from small atoms to big ecosystems, necessitates an increasingly large computational component to perform analyses. Novel DNA sequencing technologies and complementary high-throughput approaches--such as proteomics, genomics, metabolomics, and meta-genomics--drive data-intensive bioinformatics. While individual research centers or universities could once provide for these applications, this is no longer the case. Today, only specialized national centers can deliver the level of computing resources required to meet the challenges posed by rapid data growth and the resulting computational demand. Consequently, we are developing massively parallel applications to analyze the growing flood of biological data and contribute to the rapid discovery of novel knowledge.Methods: The efforts of previous National Science Foundation (NSF) projects provided for the generation of parallel modules for widely used bioinformatics applications on the Kraken supercomputer. We have profiled and optimized the code of some of the scientific community's most widely used desktop and small-cluster-based applications, including BLAST from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), HMMER, and MUSCLE; scaled them to tens of thousands of cores on high-performance computing (HPC) architectures; made them robust and portable to next-generation architectures; and incorporated these parallel applications in science gateways with a web-based portal.Results: This paper will discuss the various developmental stages, challenges, and solutions involved in taking bioinformatics applications from the desktop to petascale with a front-end portal for very-large-scale data analysis in the life sciences.Conclusions: This research will help to bridge the gap between the rate of data generation and the speed at which scientists can study this data.

Virtual laboratories (vLABs) are a potential means to enable interactive learning experiences. A vLAB focusing on Western Blotting was developed and implemented in a 3rd year undergraduate Pathology course for science students to facilitate learning of technical molecular laboratory skills that are linked to development of diagnostic skills. Such skills are important for undergraduates in building a conceptual understanding of translation of laboratory techniques to changes in human biology due to disease. Methods: The Western Blotting vLAB was developed and deployed using the Adaptive eLearning Platform (AeLP) developed by Smart Sparrow (https://www.smartsparrow.com/). The vLAB was evaluated to assess students' perceptions of their laboratory skills relevant to the diagnosis of Muscular Dystrophy. A blended learning rotation model was applied in which wet laboratory and vLAB environments for Western Blotting were both delivered to three consecutive cohorts of 3rd year science undergraduates undertaking a Muscle Diseases practical class. Evaluation questionnaires were administered at the completion of the practical classes. Results: Students indicated in online questionnaires that the Western Blotting vLAB was at least equivalent to the real lab in their perceived development of concepts, laboratory skills and diagnosis of disease. Conclusions: vLABs have great potential for improving students' development of diagnostic skills.

The project brainstormed with chemists and decided to investigate ways to facilitate monitoring and collection of experimental data. A frequently encountered use-case was identified of how the chemist reaches the end of an experiment, but finds an unexpected result. The ability to replay events can significantly help make sense of how things progressed. The project therefore concentrated on collecting a variety of dimensions of ancillary data - data that would not normally be collected due to practicality constraints. There were three main areas of investigation: 1) Development of a monitoring tool using infrared and ultrasonic sensors; 2) Time-lapse motion video capture (for example, videoing 5 seconds in every 60); and 3) Activity-driven video monitoring of the fume cupboard environs. The Ami client application was developed to control these separate logging functions. The application builds up a timeline of the events in the experiment and around the fume cupboard. The videos and data logs can then be reviewed after the experiment in order to help the chemist determine the exact timings and conditions used. The project experimented with ways in which a Microsoft Kinect could be used in a laboratory setting. Investigations suggest that it would not be an ideal device for controlling a mouse, but it shows promise for usages such as manipulating virtual molecules. © 2011 Brooks et al; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.","speech recognition, Video Capture, Fume Cupboard, Speech Recognition Package, Java Medium Framework",0,0,1,1

However, the physically distributed nature of data resources and of expertise in advanced analytical tools creates many challenges for the modern scientist. Across the wider biological sciences, presenting such capabilities on the Internet (as ""Web services"") and using scientific workflow systems to compose them for particular tasks is a practical way to carry out robust ""in silico"" science. However, use of this approach in biodiversity science and ecology has thus far been quite limited. Results: BioVeL is a virtual laboratory for data analysis and modelling in biodiversity science and ecology, freely accessible via the Internet. BioVeL includes functions for accessing and analysing data through curated Web services; for performing complex in silico analysis through exposure of R programs, workflows, and batch processing functions; for on-line collaboration through sharing of workflows and workflow runs; for experiment documentation through reproducibility and repeatability; and for computational support via seamless connections to supporting computing infrastructures. We developed and improved more than 60 Web services with significant potential in many different kinds of data analysis and modelling tasks. We composed reusable workflows using these Web services, also incorporating R programs. Deploying these tools into an easy-to-use and accessible 'virtual laboratory', free via the Internet, we applied the workflows in several diverse case studies. We opened the virtual laboratory for public use and through a programme of external engagement we actively encouraged scientists and third party application and tool developers to try out the services and contribute to the activity. Conclusions: Our work shows we can deliver an operational, scalable and flexible Internet-based virtual laboratory to meet new demands for data processing and analysis in biodiversity science and ecology. In particular, we have successfully integrated existing and popular tools and practices from different scientific disciplines to be used in biodiversity and ecological research. © 2016 The Author(s).","Analysis, automation, Biodiversity science, Biodiversity virtual e-laboratory, Computing software, data processing, Ecology, Informatics, virtual laboratory, workflows",0,1,0,1

Existing solutions for managing data typically use unstructured file systems or relational databases. These systems are not designed to provide instantaneous response to user queries. Furthermore, they do not support rapid data analysis and visualization to enable interactive experiments. In large scale experiments, this behaviour slows research discovery, discourages the widespread sharing and reuse of data that could otherwise inform critical decisions in a timely manner and encourage effective collaboration between groups. Results: In this paper we present SensorDB, a web based virtual laboratory that can manage large volumes of biological time series sensor data while supporting rapid data queries and real-time user interaction. SensorDB is sensor agnostic and uses web-based, state-of-the-art cloud and storage technologies to efficiently gather, analyse and visualize data.

In this way, Go-Lab enables inquiry-based learning that promotes acquisition of deep conceptual domain knowledge and inquiry skills, with the further intent of interesting students in careers in science. For students, Go-Lab offers the opportunity to perform scientific experiments with online labs in pedagogically structured learning spaces. Go-Lab’s inquiry learning spaces (ILSs) structure the students’ inquiry process through an inquiry cycle and provide students with guidance in which dedicated (and connected) scaffolds for inquiry processes play a pivotal role. Teachers can create and adapt inquiry learning phases and the associated guidance in an ILS through a simple wiki-like interface and can add scaffolds and tools to an ILS using a straightforward drag and drop feature. Teachers can also adapt scaffolds and tools (e.g., change the language or the concepts available in a concept mapper) through an “app composer”. In creating ILSs, teachers are supported by scenarios and associated defaults ILSs that can be used as a starting point for development. In addition, teachers are offered a community framework to disseminate best practices and find mutual support. For lab-owners, Go-Lab provides open interfacing solutions for easily plugging in their online labs and sharing them in the Go-Lab federation of online labs. In its first year, Go-Lab created ILSs for thirteen online labs from different lab providers, including renowned research organizations (e.g., CERN, ESA) that participate in the consortium. The design of these inquiry learning spaces has been evaluated through mock-ups and prototypes with students and teachers. More advanced and later versions will be evaluated and validated in large scale pilots. The sustainability of Go-Lab will come from the opportunity for the larger science education community to add new online labs and share ILSs.

In the area of education, self-efficacy plays a crucial role in causing behavioral changes, resulting in enhanced performance over the course of learning. In chemistry education, students often develop anxiety towards performing experiments due to the perceived negative outcomes resulting from lack of understanding and improper experimentation. This anxiety negatively impacts the self-efficacy of students in performing laboratory experiments. We define student-held beliefs about their experimental skills as ’experimental self-efficacy’ (ESE), and examine the four prominent factors that impact ESE in chemical laboratories. Through the development of an instrument, this work characterizes ESE and the impact of pre-laboratory interventions such as exposure to virtual laboratories (VL) on ESE and conceptual knowledge of students. Furthermore, analysis using statistical techniques such as t-tests and dissimilarity matrices reveal the positive impact of VL in enhancing students’ ESE. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anxiety, Chemistry, Conceptual learning, Physical laboratory, Self-efficacy, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The oncoming climate changes will exert influence on the ecosystems, on the all branches of the international economy, and on the quality of life. Regional climate models (RCMs) are important instruments used for downscaling climate simulations from Global circulation models (GCMs). The air quality (AQ) impact on human health and quality of life is an issue of great social significance. Evaluating this impact will give scientifically robust basis for elaborating efficient short term measures and long term strategies for mitigation of the harmful effects of air pollution.

In 2006 during 1-h pulse experiments, 90 gigabytes of data was acquired, a new world record. This data explosion has been enabled by the massively distributed processing architecture and the newly developed capability of realtime streaming acquisition. The former provides linear expandability since increasing the number of parallel DAQs avoids I/O bottlenecks. The latter improves the unit performance from 0.7 megabytes/s in conventional CAM AC digitizers to nonstop 110 megabytes/s in CompactPCI. The technical goal of this system is to be able to handle one hundred 100 megabytes/s concurrent DAQs even for steady-state plasma diagnostics. This is similar to the data production rate of the next-generation experiments, such as ITER. The LABCOM storage has several hundred terabytes of storage in double-tier structure: The first consists of tens of hard drive arrays, and the second some Blu-ray Disc libraries. Multiplex and redundant storage servers are mandatory for higher availability and throughputs. They together serve sharable volumes on Red Hat GFS2 cluster file systems.

A computational platform enabling best practice genomics analysis ideally meets a number of requirements, including: a wide range of analysis and visualisation tools, closely linked to large user and reference data sets; workflow platform(s) enabling accessible, reproducible, portable analyses, through a flexible set of interfaces; highly available, scalable computational resources; and flexibility and versatility in the use of these resources to meet demands and expertise of a variety of users. Access to an appropriate computational platform can be a significant barrier to researchers, as establishing such a platform requires a large upfront investment in hardware, experience, and expertise.

Nevertheless, the scientists concerned with the new technology soon recognized the lack of documentation standards in the 3D projects, leading to the loss of information, findings and the fusion of knowledge behind the digital 3D representation. Based on the methodological fundamentals of digital 3D reconstruction, the potentials and challenges in the light of emerging Semantic Web and Web3D technologies is introduced here. The presentation describes a scientific methodology and a collaborative web-based research environment followed by crucial features for these kinds of projects. As the groundwork, a human- and machine-readable “language of objects” and the implementation of these semantic patterns for spatial research purposes on destroyed and/or never realized tangible cultural heritage will be discussed. Using examples from the practice, the presentation explains the requirements of the Semantic Web (Linked Data), the role of controlled vocabularies, the architecture of the VRE and the impact of a customized integration of interactive 3D models within WebGL technology. The presentation intends to showcase the state-of-the-art steps on the way to a digital research infrastructure. The focus lies on the introduction of scholarly approved and sustainable digital 3D reconstruction, compliant with recognized documentation standards and following the Linked Data requirements. © 2017 SDH Open Access Journal","3D modeling, Data modeling, Digital hypothetical 3D reconstruction, linked data, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1
10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120677,Energy Material Network Data Hubs Software Platforms for Advancing Collaborative Energy Materials Research,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,2021,Article,"In early 2015 the United States Department of Energy conceived of a consortium of collaborative bodies based on shared expertise, data, and resources that could be targeted towards the more difficult problems in energy materials research. The concept of virtual laboratories had been envisioned and discussed earlier in the decade in response to the advent of the Materials Genome Initiative and similar scientific thrusts. To be effective, any virtual laboratory needed a robust method for data management, communication, security, data sharing, dissemination, and demonstration to work efficiently and effectively for groups of remote researchers. With the accessibility of new, easily deployed cloud technology and software frameworks, such individual elements could be integrated, and the required collaboration architecture is now possible. The developers have leveraged open-source software frameworks, customized them, and merged them into a platform to enable collaborative energy materials science, regardless of the geographic dispersal of the people and resources. After five years in operations, the systems are demonstratively an effective platform for enabling research within the Energy Material Networks (EMN). This paper will show the design and development of a secured scientific data sharing platform, the ability to customize the system to support diverse workflows, and examples of the enabled research and results connected with some of the Energy Material Networks. © 2021.

Teachers in Vocational High School (VHS) in Indonesia are expected to bring technology-based innovations to achieve success in learning. Learning facilities are one of the factors supporting the success of learning class. Ideally, Indonesian Vocational High Schools have facilities and infrastructure following industrial. Currently, schools have difficulty providing learning support facilities and infrastructure following those in the industry. Thus, the equipment in the school laboratory is irrelevant to the existing equipment in the industry.

Before the distillation, it is common to have a preheating stage, where the crude oil circulates through a heat exchanger in order to increase the temperature around 393K, and then, for its subsequent passage through a methane furnace it reaches a temperature of 793K. The furnace structure has a network of tubes that allows the circulation of crude oil, while a mixture of fuel (methane) and oxygen is burned in order to provide the heat. The paper presents the results of designing and developing a heat exchanger and furnace in a virtual environment in order to represent the preheating process of crude oil that is installed before the distillation tower, as well as mathematical modeling with Laplace transform and Padé approximant to include the delay factor in each thermal process for its further conversion to discrete time by using finite difference method to finally implement discrete PID controllers.

Online sessions and active learning for such courses pose challenges to both teachers and students, especially during this pandemic period. In order to combat these challenges, and to kindle the interest among the students in learning the course, a new methodology which supports blended learning through virtual experience is presented in this paper. The proposed methodology was implemented for the third year engineering students of circuit branches. This paper highlights the effectiveness of using open source emulating environments like Edsim51 and EMU8086 for providing a virtual laboratory experience to the students. These virtual environment provides a complete visualization of the internal functionality of the microprocessor/microcontroller architecture, and also enhances practical exposure of the students. In order to further augment the students’ affinity towards the course, the teacher adopts different pedagogical approaches, which is best suited for ICT based blended learning in the online teaching environment. The assessment of this virtual experience is carried out using different online assessment components such as quizzes, assignments as concept maps/videos shared by the students, mini projects etc. Based on the assessment results, an analysis is carried out and it shows significant improvement in student engagement, in depth understanding of the course and improvement in programming skills of the students.

Scaling out Tele-Lab to a public cloud is one alternative to making it more available and scalable. Public clouds are very flexible in providing resources since customers can add or reduce resources whenever needed. A second alternative is the reduction of resources needed for a single training environment, e.g. by replacing the virtualization technology in Tele-Lab with the one that uses fewer resources than full-fledged virtual machines.

New types of research outputs, modes of scientific communication and new circulation mechanisms, as well as enhanced opportunities for scientific re-use and measuring research impact, in combination with new approaches to research assessment and evaluation are all having profound effects on the social system of science. To be sure that these innovations will not break the social sustainability of the science community, it will be valuable to develop a model of science as a tool for computer simulation of social consequences from possible innovations within virtual research environment. Focusing on possible social problems related to these new virtual research environments this short paper provides a brief analysis of the current situation in science (challenges, problems, main actors), general views on model of science (landscape, main agents, important properties, etc.) and on areas where simulation can contribute to better understanding of possible futures for the scientific community. © Copyright JASSS.","Agent Based Modeling, Science System Social Sustainability, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

However, these sensitive areas are under increasing pressures that significantly threaten their future sustainability. To help better manage tropical regions, a need exists for more informed environmental monitoring procedures. Currently, data is collected in disjoint repositories that are not visible or accessible for reuse. As data is not being publicised, there are missed opportunities for the holistic discovery of trends that influence tropical ecosystems. This paper presents the Tropical Data Hub as an e-research infrastructure to congregate significant tropical data sets for cross-domain analyses and knowledge discovery. The Hub serves as a focal point for the amalgamation of disparate data sources to facilitate data reuse, integration, searching, and correlation by environmental researchers and government departments for discovery and decision making. More suitable environmental management practices may then be devised via cross-disciplinary data that depicts a more accurate representation of the status. The system automates the data capture process and incorporates semantic technologies to provide knowledge discovery. We present two successful visualisation applications that demonstrate the Hub's capacity to enhance tropical environmental research. The first assesses land space use, and the second assesses potential impacts of climate change on global biodiversity. © Common Ground, Trina Myers, Jarrod Trevathan, Ian Atkinson, All Rights Reserved.","Environmental monitoring, knowledge discovery, Semantic technologies, Tropical biodiversity, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

It has been used to investigate imaging system's sensitivity, data acquisition methods, or image reconstruction algorithms. The GATE system, based on the Monte Carlo method, operates relying on user-provided scripts that follow the program definitions in the system's command library. Script-writing is usually time-consuming and frequently error-associated unless one has had certain experience in the simulation field and is familiar with programming. This is obviously an obstacle to students and beginners. The learning curve of script-writing is relatively flat to nonprogramming background learners. In addition, the GATE system is commonly installed on a high-performance computer, on which the scripts are usually compiled and used by the user only. In order to utilize GATE's potential to be a routine simulation toolkit, we have developed QGATE, a GUI-based GATE system. The QGATE system provides users a graphical environment where a simulation design is achieved by fashions like ""drag-and-drop objects"" and ""choose-and-modify parameters"". The scripts will be automatically generated and complied by the system. Parameters belonging to each object have default values so as to avoid errors induced by new users. The QGATE system consists of one or more QGATE Clients and one QGATE Server. The Client can be installed on individual computers so that multiple users can work on their simulation projects simultaneously by using the graphical designing tools. The Server is installed on the same computer as the GATE system resides. The Server manages the submitted simulation scripts queued by a job ticket and returns the job finish signal to the corresponding client. The QGATE system is suitable for classroom training and easy to use for students or new users to the field of nuclear medicine imaging simulation. © Li and Zhao.","GUI, PET, Server-client, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1
10.2196/13993,Development and evaluation of a virtual research environment to improve quality of care in overcrowded emergency departments: Observational study,JMIR Serious Games,2019,Article,"Background: Despite a wide range of literature on emergency department (ED) overcrowding, scientific knowledge on emergency physicians' cognitive processes coping with overcrowding is limited. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a virtual research environment that will allow us to study the effect of physicians' strategies and behaviors on quality of care in the context of ED overcrowding. Methods: A simulation-based observational study was conducted over two stages: The development of a simulation model and its evaluation. A research environment in emergency medicine combining virtual reality and simulated patients was designed and developed. Afterwards, 12 emergency physicians took part in simulation scenarios and had to manage 13 patients during a 2-hour period. The study outcome was the authenticity of the environment through realism, consistency, and mastering. The realism was the resemblance perceived by the participants between virtual and real ED. The consistency of the scenario and the participants' mastering of the environment was expected for 90% (12/13) of the participants. Results: The virtual ED was considered realistic with no significant difference from the real world with respect to facilities and resources, except for the length of time of procedures that was perceived to be shorter. A total of 100% (13/13) of participants deemed that patient information, decision making, and managing patient flow were similar to real clinical practice. The virtual environment was well-mastered by all participants over the course of the scenarios. Conclusions: The new simulation tool, Virtual Research Environment in Emergency Medicine, has been successfully designed and developed. It has been assessed as perfectly authentic by emergency physicians compared with real EDs and thus offers another way to study human factors, quality of care, and patient safety in the context of ED overcrowding. © 2019 JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies.

Science Gateways (SG) are recently emerging as high-level web environments that ease Grid access and use. However, although SGs simplify job management, providing a web interface by which jobs can be submitted with a few ""clicks"", their capabilities to do an effective and intuitive data management are still at an early stage. Actually, Grid storage elements use dedicated protocols not supported by common applications such as web browsers. This makes a smooth integration of data management services in a Science Gateway quite difficult. In this work we show the Data Engine, a new SG component providing users with the ability to move data to storage elements and share them in an easy and clever way.

10.22323/1.293.0015,Data Provenance Tracking as the Basis for a Biomedical Virtual Research Environment,International Symposium on Grids and Clouds,2017,Conference Paper,"In complex data analyses it is increasingly important to capture information about the usage of data sets in addition to their preservation over time to ensure reproducibility of results, to verify the work of others and to ensure appropriate conditions data have been used for specific analyses. Scientific workflow based studies are beginning to realize the benefit of capturing this provenance of data and the activities used to process, transform and carry out studies on those data. This is especially true in biomedicine where the collection of data through experiment is costly and/or difficult to reproduce and where that data needs to be preserved over time. One way to support the development of workflows and their use in (collaborative) biomedical analyses is through the use of a Virtual Research Environment. The dynamic and distributed nature of Grid/Cloud computing, however, makes the capture and processing of provenance information a major research challenge. Furthermore most workflow provenance management services are designed only for data-flow oriented workflows and researchers are now realising that tracking data or workflows alone or separately is insufficient to support the scientific process. What is required for collaborative research is traceable and reproducible provenance support in a full orchestrated Virtual Research Environment (VRE) that enables researchers to define their studies in terms of the datasets and processes used, to monitor and visualize the outcome of their analyses and to log their results so that others users can call upon that acquired knowledge to support subsequent studies. We have extended the work carried out in the neuGRID and N4U projects in providing a so-called Virtual Laboratory to provide the foundation for a generic VRE in which sets of biomedical data (images, laboratory test results, patient records, epidemiological analyses etc.) and the workflows (pipelines) used to process those data, together with their provenance data and results sets are captured in the CRISTAL software. This paper outlines the functionality provided for a VRE by the Open Source CRISTAL software and examines how that can provide the foundations for a practice-based knowledge base for biomedicine and, potentially, for a wider research community.

The research profile of the DHLab integrates computer science, digital imaging, computational photography, the accessibility of digital objects and solutions for digital preservation with the aim to support scholars in the emerging field of humanities research. The project Digital Materiality, a collaboration with the Seminar of Art History, examines how new imaging and visualization methods can be applied to describe the reflection of light on surfaces of artworks. Of main interest are mosaics and early prints; both types of artworks have a strong interaction with light that can not captured adequately by standard photographic approaches. Conventional photographic processes are not able to capture the dynamic component of the light-surface interdependence that is specific for this kind of art. The technical part of the project focuses on improving the methodology that is in general described as Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) techniques. RTI is an approach based on a mathematical model, that is fitted in image data derived from photographs. By modifying the mathematical model that is used to represent the light-surface interaction, the digital reproduction can be improved so that relevant attributes of artworks can be transported into the digital domain in such a way that the requirements and needs of humanities researchers to a digital representation can be fulfilled. The improvements take into account more sophisticated but still robust and simple reflection models for the realistic visualization of localized diffuse and specular surfaces within the same digital reproduction. For humanities research the most important aspect is the compatibility to web-based Virtual Research Environments (VRE).

The provision of laboratory work to engineering students helps them familiarize themselves with similar situations as they will find real life as they practice their profession. Primarily, this laboratory work is based on actual hardware and a laboratory where the students can work at a specified time, perform experiments under the guidance of a lab technician and leave with data that they can analyze later using the knowledge they learned in class. These laboratories and the hardware equipment in them are expensive to acquire and maintain. Also, they are an expensive upgrade, yet upgrading is inevitable with the rapid change in technology we are all experiencing.

Inclusion of new technology and complexity into the airspace increases the importance and difficulty of safety assurance. Additionally, testing new technologies on complex aviation systems and systems of systems can be challenging, expensive, and at at times unsafe when implementing real life scenarios. The application of prognostics to aviation and airspace management may produce new tools and insight into these problems. Prognostic methodology provides an estimate of the health and risks of a component, vehicle, or airspace and knowledge of how that will change over time. That measure is especially useful in safety determination, mission planning, and maintenance scheduling. In our research, we develop a live, distributed, hardwarein-the-loop Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed for aviation and airspace prognostics. The developed testbed will be used to validate prediction algorithms for the real-time safety monitoring of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the prediction of unsafe events. In our earlier work1 we discussed the initial Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed development work and related results for milestones 1 & 2 . This paper describes the design, development, and testing of the integrated tested which are part of milestone 3, along with our next steps for validation of this work. Through a framework consisting of software/hardware modules and associated interface clients, the distributed testbed enables safe, accurate, and inexpensive experimentation and research into airspace and vehicle prognosis that would not have been possible otherwise. The testbed modules can be used cohesively to construct complex and relevant airspace scenarios for research. Four modules are key to this research: the virtual aircraft module which uses the X-Plane simulator and X-PlaneConnect toolbox, the live aircraft module which connects fielded aircraft using onboard cellular communications devices, the hardware in the loop (HITL) module which connects laboratory based bench-top hardware testbeds and the research module which contains diagnostics and prognostics tools for analysis of live air traffic situations and vehicle health conditions. The testbed also features other modules for data recording and playback, information visualization, and air traffic generation.

Most medical laboratory educators prefer to use manual or semiautomated methods to teach hemostasis so that students can ""see"" what is occurring during the testing method, but many semi-automated instruments are no longer commercially available or are not cost-effective for education programs. In consideration of these factors and due to programmatic expansion to a coordinate campus, the CLS program explored new ways to teach hemostasis methods equitably and affordably across two distant locations. Working with an instructional design team versed in online education, five virtual hemostasis laboratory exercises were created that mimic the manual methodologies. Web-based didactic instruction was also developed to teach the testing theory and pathophysiology related to patient results. The efficacy of the virtual instruction was evaluated through assessment of student performance on exam questions, professional certification scores for the platelet/hemostasis sub-category, student satisfaction surveys, and evaluation of student performance during their clinical experience. Results showed that students in the virtual delivery format performed significantly better on exam questions compared to the traditional delivery method group, but there was no significant difference in their performance on the professional certification exam.

But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes. © IFAC.","Closed-loop control, control education, Control equipment, Real-time",0,1,0,1

There are several software packages that support in silico modeling. However, these tools require lot of compute resources and special technical knowledge. As a result, many bio-scientists cannot use them.

This environment enables bio-scientists to execute simple molecular modeling scenarios or build more complex use-cases from existing building blocks while hiding the technical details of the infrastructure. Four scenarios have been defined and deconstructed in order to identify common building blocks supporting a large number of complex use-cases.

The biggest hurdle remains the magnitude and diversity of the datasets generated, compromising our ability to manage, organize, process and ultimately analyse data. The Wiki-based Automated Sequence Processor (WASP), developed at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (hereafter Einstein), uniquely manages to tightly couple the sequencing platform, the sequencing assay, sample metadata and the automated workflows deployed on a heterogeneous high performance computing cluster infrastructure that yield sequenced, quality-controlled and 'mapped' sequence data, all within the one operating environment accessible by a web-based GUI interface.WASP at Einstein processes 4-6 TB of data per week and since its production cycle commenced it has processed ∼ 1 PB of data overall and has revolutionized user interactivity with these new genomic technologies, who remain blissfully unaware of the data storage, management and most importantly processing services they request. The abstraction of such computational complexity for the user in effect makes WASP an ideal middleware solution, and an appropriate basis for the development of a grid-enabled resource - the Einstein Genome Gateway - as part of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) program.

The handling of large data sets will become a limiting factor-even for data intensive applications running on future Exascale systems. Nowadays, Big Data can be more a collection of challenges for data processing at large scale and less a tool box of solutions used to improve applications, scale well, and handle the constantly growing data sets. There is an urgent need for intelligent mechanisms to acquire, process, and analyze data, which have to run and scale efficiently on current and future computing architectures. The complexity of Big Data applications will highly profit from flexible workflow systems that consider the full data life cycle, from data acquisition to long-term storage and towards the curation of knowledge. To maximize the applicability of HPC systems for Big Data workflows, several changes in the system architecture and its software need to be considered. First, in order to exploit all available I/O capacities an adaptable monitoring system needs to collect information about I/O patterns of application and workflows as well as provide information to model the I/O subsystem. The goal is to collect long term performance data, to evaluate this data, and finally to show how and why resources cannot be used to their full potential. Second, as the complexity of systems is continuously increasing, the level of abstraction that is presented to the user needs to increase with at least the same rate in order to ensure that the current usability is at least maintained.

The so-called virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) which are used to support university classes are significantly affected by this technological obsolescence, decreasing their formative effectiveness as the obsolescence process advances. In this study, the technological obsolescence of two VRLEs is analyzed by means of an empirical research based on survey results (N = 135) after using the VRLEs in engineering classes. Several key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed during seven academic courses, including motivation, interactivity, ease of use and usefulness. Since both VRLEs were updated during this research work, the influence of these improvements is discussed in detail from a technological obsolescence point of view. Results suggest that the technological obsolescence negatively affects the students' opinion regarding motivation and interactivity, but the other KPIs (ease of use and usefulness) are hardly affected. In contrast, results indicate that the technological obsolescence can be reversed if periodic updates of educational tools are carried out using modern development software. © 2020 by the author.

These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students’ abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and gamebased platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform.

10.3390/data5020039,An on-demand service for managing and analyzing arctic sea ice high spatial resolution imagery,Data,2020,Article,"Sea ice acts as both an indicator and an amplifier of climate change. High spatial resolution (HSR) imagery is an important data source in Arctic sea ice research for extracting sea ice physical parameters, and calibrating/validating climate models. HSR images are difficult to process and manage due to their large data volume, heterogeneous data sources, and complex spatiotemporal distributions. In this paper, an Arctic Cyberinfrastructure (ArcCI) module is developed that allows a reliable and efficient on-demand image batch processing on the web. For this module, available associated datasets are collected and presented through an open data portal. The ArcCI module offers an architecture based on cloud computing and big data components for HSR sea ice images, including functionalities of (1) data acquisition through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) transfer, front-end uploading, and physical transfer; (2) data storage based on Hadoop distributed file system and matured operational relational database; (3) distributed image processing including object-based image classification and parameter extraction of sea ice features; (4) 3D visualization of dynamic spatiotemporal distribution of extracted parameters with flexible statistical charts. Arctic researchers can search and find arctic sea ice HSR image and relevant metadata in the open data portal, obtain extracted ice parameters, and conduct visual analytics interactively. Users with large number of images can leverage the service to process their image in high performance manner on cloud, and manage, analyze results in one place. The ArcCI module will assist domain scientists on investigating polar sea ice, and can be easily transferred to other HSR image processing research projects. © 2020 by the authors.

This study developed a prototype for a virtual laboratory for powder-bed binder jetting three-dimensional printing (3DP) training in universities. The 3DP virtual laboratory is expected to address problems encountered in teaching, training, and practicing with powder-bed binder jetting 3DP. The 3DP Training Virtual Laboratory was developed by using immersive VR technology to simulate two-handed operations. The user evaluation of the first version prototype revealed that the students lacked learning interest and motivation when using the prototype. Thus, gamification technology was integrated into the 3DP virtual laboratory prototype in the mid-implementation development phase. After refining and systematically developing the model to meet the modified requirements, user evaluations on the game elements showed positive feedback. This study concluded that elements of gamification design should be considered at the beginning of the educational or training system development in order to enhance students’ motivation or engagement. © 2020 by the author.

On the other hand, one of the main goals of higher education is to develop students’ cooperative competence. This experimental study pre-sents an online learning environment, consisting of a set of web-based resources such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, educational videos and a game-based learning methodology. The study also examines the influence of the combination of such resources with active and collaborative learning on the improvement of students’ relationships and the development of cooperative com-petence. To this end, an analysis was conducted based on the data collected from a core subject of the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Engineering degree courses. The answers of an online survey (n = 289) were examined by using the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results suggest that the proposed learning environment has a significant and positive impact on the two dimensions of relational coordination; communication and relationships, and plays a key role in the acquisition and development of cooperative competence.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the educational potential of these virtual environments (e.g., virtual laboratories) is of particular interest to a wider scientific community, with numerous successful examples coming from different fields, starting from social sciences, to STEM disciplines. However, when it comes to agent theory, which is a highly important part of the general AI (Artificial Intelligence) research focus, there is a noticeable absence of such educational tools. To be more precise, there is a certain lack of virtual educational systems dedicated primarily to agents. That was the motivation for the development of the AViLab (Agents Virtual Laboratory) gamified system, as a demonstration tool for educational purposes in the related subject of agent theory. The developed system is thoroughly described in this paper. The current version of the AViLab consists of several agents (developed according to the agenda elaborated in the manuscript), aiming to demonstrate certain insights into fundamental agent structures. Although the task imposed to our agents essentially represents a sort of “picking” or “collecting” task, the scenario in the system is rather gamified, in order to be more immersive for potential users, spectators, or possible test subjects. This kind of task was chosen because of its wide applicability in both, gaming scenarios and real-world everyday scenarios. In order to demonstrate how AViLab can be utilized, we conducted an exemplar experiment, described in the paper. Alongside its educational purpose, the AViLab system also has the potential to be used for research purposes in the related subjects of agent theory, AI, and game AI, especially regarding future system extensions (including the introduction of new scenarios, more advanced agents, etc.). © 2022 by the authors.

The user can choose any of these physical systems and they have the options to control them using either continuous-time or discrete-time controllers. All parameters of the plant are fully configurable by the user. After that, the controller can be designed and tested.

Cancelled labs as a result of weather, the inability to visit a wide variety of terrain location, recent distance education requirements create significant instructional challenges. In this paper, we present a software solution called surveying reality (SurReal); this software allows for students to conduct immersive and interactive virtual reality labs. This paper discusses the development of a virtual differential leveling lab. The developed software faithfully replicates major steps followed in the field and any skills learned in virtual reality are transferable in the physical world. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel technique for leveling multi-legged objects like a tripod on variable terrain. This method relies solely on geometric modeling and does not require physical simulation of the tripod. This increases efficiency and ensures that the user experiences at least 60 frames per second, thus reducing lagging and creating a pleasant experience for the user. We conduct two leveling examples, a three-benchmark loop and a point-to-point leveling line.

While considering that control engineering laboratories are expensive, mainly because educational plants should reproduce classical problems that are found in the industry, the use of virtual laboratories appears as an interesting strategy for reducing costs and improving the diversity of experiments. In this research, remote experimentation was assumed regarding the ball and beam process as an alternative didactic methodology. While assuming a nonlinear and unstable open-loop process, this study presents how students should proceed to control the plant focusing on the topic that is associated with multiobjective optimization. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller was tuned considering the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to illustrate the WebLab learning procedures described in this research. The proposed strategy was compared to the Astrom's robust loop shaping method to emphasize the performance of the multiobjective optimization technique.

Scientific modeling is key to enable the transition from data to knowledge, often requiring to process big datasets through complex physical or empirical (learning-based AI) models. Although cloud technologies provide valuable solutions for addressing several of the Big Earth Data challenges, model sharing is still a complex task. The usual approach of sharing models as services requires maintaining a scalable infrastructure which is often a very high barrier for potential model providers. This paper describes the Virtual Earth Laboratory (VLab), a software framework orchestrating data and model access to implement scientific processes for knowledge generation. The VLab lowers the entry barriers for both developers and users. It adopts mature containerization technologies to access models as source code and to rebuild the required software environment to run them on any supported cloud. This makes VLab fitting in the multi-cloud landscape, which is going to characterize the Big Earth Data analytics domain in the next years.

However, performing experiments in real conditions is usually expensive in terms of time, money and energy, as it requires expensive infrastructures that are generally difficult to maintain in good conditions. To overcome this problem, virtual reality has proven to be a powerful tool to achieve sustainability, making it easy to update laboratories without the need to acquire new equipment. Moreover, the ability to introduce practical knowledge into classrooms without leaving them, makes virtual laboratories capable of simulating typical operating environments as well as extreme situations in the operation of different devices. A typical subject in which students can benefit from the use of virtual laboratories is robotics. In this work we will develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) pedagogical simulator of industrial robotic arms for engineering students. With the proposed system, students will know the effects of their own designed trajectories on several different robotic arms and cell environments without having to buy all of them and being safe of damaging the cell components. The simulation will be checking for collisions of the elements in the scene and alert the student when they happen. This can be achieved with a robotic simulator, but the integration with immersive VR is intended to help students better understand robotics. Moreover, even having a real robotic arm available for students, with this proposed VR method, all the students have the opportunity to manage and learn his own version of the robotic cell, without waiting times generated by having less robotic arms than students in classroom. © 2018 by the authors.","education, Pedagogy, robotics, simulations, virtual reality",0,1,0,1

Both the developed and developing countries will have to face increasing challenges to match the greater demand of clean and safe water, looking for supplies far from the residential area. This situation will be furtherly exasperated by the effects of climate change which, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events, will reduce the availability and the quality of water resources and will subject the population to serious and ongoing hazards. In such context, an accurate and continuous monitoring of surface waters represents a fundamental step to reduce the contamination status and plan actions for a sustainable management of this resource. In the last years, the development of advanced methodologies and high-tech equipment able to lower the times and costs of the field surveys has not been associated with an appropriate training of the technical staff of public and private bodies responsible for the control of the territory. In most cases, unable to outsource highly qualified personnel due to lack of funding, such bodies tend to reduce the monitoring activities, leaving the areas even more subject to the risk of disastrous events.

Nevertheless, in order to design very efficient solar energy systems, it is crucial to have a good solar radiation database. There are databases where it is possible to find information on solar radiation, but only for horizontal surfaces. Afterwards, it is necessary to transform the horizontal solar radiation data to tilt solar radiation data.

To illustrate our study, we propose a course related to energy efficient and safe weighted clustering algorithm. This algorithm which is coupled with suitable routing protocols, aims to maintain stable clustering structure, to prevent most routing attacks on sensor networks, to guaranty energy saving in order to extend the lifespan of the network. It also offers a better performance in terms of the number of re-affiliations. The platform presented here aims at showing the feasibility, the flexibility and the reduced cost of such a realization.

However, building them requires expert knowledge of galaxy modeling and simulation techniques, significant investment in software development, and access to high performance computing. These requirements make it difficult for a small research team or individual to quickly build a mock catalog suited to their needs. To address this TAO offers access to multiple cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models from an intuitive and clean web interface. Results can be funnelled through science modules and sent to a dedicated supercomputer for further processing and manipulation. These modules include the ability to (1) construct custom observer light cones from the simulation data cubes; (2) generate the stellar emission from star formation histories, apply dust extinction, and compute absolute and/or apparent magnitudes; and (3) produce mock images of the sky.

However, the comparison of morphological and genetic data is sometimes hindered by the lack of cultures of several cyanobacterial morphospecies and inadequate morphological data of sequenced strains (Rajaniemi et al. 2005). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity within defined taxa, the variability observed in cultures has to be compared to the range in natural variation (Komárek and Mareš 2012). Thus, new tools are needed to aggregate, link and process data in a meaningful way, in order to properly study and understand cyanodiversity. New information An online database on cyanobacteria has been created, namely the Cyanobacteria culture collection (CCC) ( http://cyanobacteria.myspecies.info/) using as case studies cyanobacterial strains isolated from lakes of Greece, which are part of the AUTH culture collection (School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki). The database hosts, for the first time, information and data such as morphology/morphometry, biogeography, phylogeny, microphotographs, distribution maps, toxicology and biochemical traits of the strains.

Since the web inception two decades ago, there are multiple initiatives to connect, aggregate, share, and publish biodiversity data, and to establish data and work flows in order to analyze them. The European program LifeWatch aims at establishing a distributed network of nodes implementing virtual research environment in Europe to facilitate the work of biodiversity researchers and managers. LifeWatchGreece is one of these nodes where a portal was developed offering access to a suite of virtual laboratories and e-services. New information Despite its strict definition in information technology, in practice ""portal"" is a fairly broad term that embraces many web architectures. In the biodiversity domain, the term ""portal"" is usually used to indicate either a web site that provides access to a single or an aggregation of data repositories (like: http://indiabiodiversity.org/, http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org/, http://data.freshwaterbiodiversity.eu), a web site that gathers information about various online biodiversity tools (like http://test-eubon.ebd.csic.es/, http://marine.lifewatch.eu/) or a web site that just gathers information and news about the biodiversity domain (like http:// chm.moew.government.bg). LifeWatchGreece's portal takes the concept of a portal a step further. In strict IT terms, LifeWatchGreece's portal is partly a portal, partly a platform and partly an aggregator. It includes a number of biodiversity-related web tools integrated into a centrally-controlled software ecosystem. This ecosystem includes subsystems for access control, traffic monitoring, user notifications and web tool management. These subsystems are shared to all the web tools that have been integrated to the portal and thereby are part of this ecosystem. These web tools do not consist in external and completely independent web applications as it happens in most other portals. A quite obvious (to the user) indication of this is the Single-Sign-On (SSO) functionality for all tools and the common user interface wrapper that most of these tools use. Another example of a less obvious functionality is the common user profile that is shared and can be utilized by all tools (e.g user's timezone). © Gougousis A, Bailly N.","Biodiversity Information System, E-service, Research e-Infrastructure, Virtual Laboratories (vLab), virtual research environments",0,1,1,2

Practical experiments are not possible for clarification, since important quantities in the mathematical formulation can only made visible in experiments with extreme effort or are even inaccessible like theoretical constructs or infinitesimal values. Numerical calculations may be used to show some quantities, but students cannot carry them out for themselves. Therefore, a virtual-reality laboratory for fluid mechanics is created with the software Unreal Engine 4.

As undergraduate students learn about concrete structure, they commonly reach limits regarding their understanding of failure behavior in materials. Design codes should therefore be followed when students learn about reinforced concrete (RC) design. Students are able to follow a step-by-step design procedure for a RC beam using simple calculations. However, they usually then face some requirement, such as a design code, that requires students to make an RC beam with several pieces of rebar instead of one piece, because this provides a more desirable behavior for the RC structure. Understanding why the code is required needs more than just reading. By conducting an experiment, students can easily understand the reason for the code. However, real experiments for concrete structures are time-consuming and costly; therefore, provision of a realistic simulation tool, the 'Virtual Concrete Structure Laboratory,' for engineering educational purposes allows students to obtain virtual hands-on experience to learn about concrete structure.

However in the implementation, many obstacles are often encountered in a conventional laboratory such as lack of materials, tools, and times which make it less optimal. Evidently these issues could be solved by employing Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Thus far VR makes great contributions especially to the education sector. One of them is through combining it in the process of developing virtual laboratory. Virtual laboratory played an important role in the learning process specifically in terms of laboratory works. It was possible to manipulate 2D (virtual world) objects similar to 3D (real world) objects. This study developed Virtual Reality Laboratory (VRL) to analyze its characteristics, quality, and impact on students' cognitive achievement. A research and development (R&D) method with a post-test design was applied in this study. The subjects of this study were 102 high school students in class XI. The samples were divided into 3 classes, namely CC (real laboratory); EC-1 (VRL); and EC-2 (real laboratory and VRL). The findings of students' cognitive achievement were analyzed using ANOVA and it was found that there were significant differences in students' cognitive achievement in those three classes. Students who used VRL had higher cognitive achievement than students who used the conventional one. VRL also received excellent grades from chemistry educators. Thus, VRL is very useful as a supplement in the teaching and learning process. © 2021, International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

One of the first applications developed was a virtual microscope 1.0 (VM 1.0) to be used by students via a standard web browser. The basic idea was to offer the functionality of a microscope via an interactive application which is integrated within the LMS. The main advantages of that concept were saving costs, enhancing the flexibility for students and utilizing additional features and possibilities offered by new media. Cost saving was achieved by replacing hundreds of expensive physical microscopes by the virtual microscope, which can be used on any PC with a standard web browser. After more than 8 years the technology as well as the functionality of the VM 1.0 was now out-dated. We describe the stages to introduce a VM 2.0 within VMC/Moodle in order to help other universities who want to introduce a VM for their students to speed up the decision process and to avoid possible traps.","e-learning, Multimedia applications, New learning applications, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

However, many labs focus on providing a very specific experience, intended to prove a specific point or to carry out a specific practice, rather than to help the student acquire a wider range of skills through several different uses of the lab. This paper describes the creation of Boole-WebLab-FPGA, a system which integrates Boole-Deusto -an educational electronics design tool- and WebLab-Deusto-FPGA. The latter is a hybrid remote laboratory which lets users program a real FPGA board remotely. This real, physical board has been given the capability to interact with not only real hardware (LEDs), but also with virtual simulations of more complicated models, such as a watertank. The integration of these tools in a single system provides an attractive workflow for teachers and students. Students can design a combinational circuit easily through Boole-Deusto and immediately (in the same lecture session, if they so wish) try it on real hardware. Because additionally that real hardware can also be interacting with a virtual simulation, a wide range of experiments can be proposed and the replay potential of the laboratory is increased.","augmented reality, digital electronics, Hybrid laboratories, remote laboratories, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

All require the generation of a model grid, preparation and interpolation of topography, initial conditions, and forcing fields. Each task in configuring a regional ocean model is straightforward - but the process of downloading and reformatting data can be time-consuming. For an experienced modeller, the configuration of a new model domain can take as little as a few hours - but for an inexperienced modeller, it can take much longer. In pursuit of technical efficiency, the Australian ocean modelling community has developed the Web-based MARine Virtual Laboratory (WebMARVL). WebMARVL allows a user to quickly and easily configure an ocean general circulation or wave model through a simple interface, reducing the time to configure a regional model to a few minutes. Through WebMARVL, a user is prompted to define the basic options needed for a model configuration, including the model, run duration, spatial extent, and input data. Once all aspects of the configuration are selected, a series of data extraction, reprocessing, and repackaging services are run, and a ""take-away bundle"" is prepared for download. Building on the capabilities developed under Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System, WebMARVL also extracts all of the available observations for the chosen time-space domain. The user is able to download the take-away bundle and use it to run the model of his or her choice. Models supported by WebMARVL include three community ocean general circulation models and two community wave models. The model configuration from the take-away bundle is intended to be a starting point for scientific research. The user may subsequently refine the details of the model set-up to improve the model performance for the given application. In this study, WebMARVL is described along with a series of results from test cases comparing WebMARVL-configured models to observations and manually configured models. It is shown that the automatically configured model configurations produce a good starting point for scientific research. © Author(s) 2016.","Bundle, computer science, Domain (software engineering), simulations, Interface (Java), Process (engineering), grid, Wave model, distributed computing, virtual laboratory, Test case, lcsh:Geology, lcsh:QE1-996.5",0,1,0,1

In addition, outdoor laboratories develop student skills with instruments and surveying techniques. These laboratories are often affected by weather, leading to cancelled laboratories, which reduce the time students spend with instruments and disrupt/delay the academic plan. Furthermore, terrain characteristics are important in surveying, as each terrain and project introduce unique surveying challenges. However, training often takes places in one location, thus, limiting student comprehension and experience on how to use the same instrument and techniques in different terrain conditions. Virtual reality constantly gains ground in education, as it overcomes restrictions of physical laboratories and enhances student learning. This study discusses the development of a leveling laboratory in immersive and interactive virtual reality, as well as the challenges encountered. We have replicated a part of the Penn State Wilkes-Barre campus, where students conduct many of their physical laboratories, in virtual reality with geometric and photorealistic fidelity using remote sensing and photogrammetric methods. Dense point clouds derived from terrestrial laser scanning and small unmanned aerial surveys are used for terrain and man-made object modeling. In addition, we have developed software that simulates surveying instruments, their properties, and user/student interaction with the instrument (e.g., moving the tripod, leveling the level instrument and leveling rod, etc.). This paper demonstrates that by utilizing cutting-edge remote sensing and virtual reality technologies, we can create realistic laboratories that can supplement physical outdoor laboratories and improve/enhance undergraduate instruction of surveying students. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Numerous interventions are concentrated in the digitalisation of library collections, but also commercial companies like Microsoft or Google try to convert large analogue stocks such as books, paintings, etc. in digital form. Data in digital form can be much easier made accessible to a large user community, especially to the interested scientific community. <br><br> The aim of the described research project is to set up a virtual research environment for interdisciplinary research focusing on the landscape of the historical Mecklenburg in the north-east of Germany. Georeferenced old maps from 1786 and 1890 covering complete Mecklenburg should be combined with current geo-information, satellite and aerial imagery to support spatio-temporal research aspects in different scales in space (regional 1:200,000 to local 1:25.000) and time (nearly 250 years in three time steps, the last 30 years also in three time slices). <br><br> The Virtual Laboratory for Cultural Landscape Research (VKLandLab) is designed and developed by the Chair of Geodesy and Geoinformatics, hosted at the Computing Centre (ITMZ) and linked to the Digital Library (UB) at Rostock University. VKLandLab includes new developments such as wikis, blogs, data tagging, etc. and proven components already integrated in various data-related infrastructures such as InternetGIS, data repositories and authentication structures. The focus is to build a data-related infrastructure and a work platform that supports students as well as researchers from different disciplines in their research in space and time.","cultural landscapes, data infrastructure, interoperability, Spatial Information science, web-based",0,1,1,2
10.5220/0005439702600268,Designing a virtual laboratory for a relational database MOOC,International Conference on Computer Supported Education,2015,Conference Paper,"Technical advances in machine and system virtualization are creating opportunities for remote learning to provide significantly better support for active education approaches. Students now, in general, have personal computers that are powerful enough to support virtualization of operating systems and networks. As a consequence, it is now possible to provide remote learners with a common, standard, virtual laboratory and learning environment, independent of the different types of physical machines on which they work. This greatly enhances the opportunity for producing re-usable teaching materials that are actually re-used. However, configuring and installing such virtual laboratories is technically challenging for teachers and students. We report on our experience of building a virtual machine (VM) laboratory for a MOOC on relational databases. The architecture of our virtual machine is described in detail, and we evaluate the benefits of using the Vagrant tool for building and delivering the VM.","MOOC, Open education resources, Remote learning, Vagrant, virtualization",0,1,0,1

10.5688/ajpe7517,A virtual clean room to teach USP 797 regulations for intravenous medications,American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education,2011,Article,"Objective. To provide a virtual environment for pharmacy students to learn United States Pharmacopeia Chapter 797 (USP 797) requirements, while recognizing the role of pharmacists in the safe use of intravenous (IV) medications. Design. A virtual laboratory was created that included stations for IV medications, product verification, medication safety, and patient cases pertaining to high-alert medications. Pharmacy students used 3-D glasses and a wireless controller to navigate through the session and identify violations of USP 797 regulations. Assessment. Preassessments and postassessments were administered to students who completed the session in each of the 2 years it was offered. In the first year, 88% of students strongly agreed or agreed that the sessions met their expectation. Following their APPE clerkship, 92% of these students felt the virtual IV room prepared them for the IV clean room experience. In the second year, 88% of students felt the experience enhanced their understanding of clean room procedures. After session completion, 75% of participants perceived medication errors to be more significant. Written examinations also were administered and students' mean scores improved significantly compared to those of students' prior to implementation of the session (89.6% in year 0; 91.2% in year 1; and 96.1% in year 2). Conclusion. The immersive virtual environment is a contemporary and effective way to teach USP 797 requirements and enhance the awareness of medication errors.","Intravenous products, simulations, Sterile products, USP 797, Virtual clean room, virtual learning",0,1,0,1

During the development special attention is devoted to the fulfillment of the modularity, scalability, and openness that represent the basic requirements of reconfigurability. The reconfigurability of the virtual laboratory can be considered from two aspects: as a possibility of reconfiguring operating mode and as a possibility of reconfiguring virtual robots and virtual laboratory. It represents an integrated environment for programming, control, simulation and monitoring of multiple robots with continuous adjustment to the real laboratory environment and robots' usage. With the possibility to adjust the virtual environment in accordance with the students' foreknowledge and experience by combining different operating modes and virtual environments, from the educational viewpoint, it is expected that the proposed solution will improve the process of gaining knowledge.","education, Reconfigurability, Robot programming, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1
10.6036/8051,Virtual laboratory of industrial scenarios for training in the areas of automation and control,DYNA,2017,Article,"Automation is an area that is constantly being updated with the incorporation of new technological developments. These changes require constant training in both the academic and industrial spheres. One of the limitations of academia is the lack of infrastructure that allows the student to conduct trials in an industrial environment since both the type and number of the actuators, sensors and processors are limited to/by the infrastructure of the laboratory. For this reason, the development of a virtual industrial lab is posed where components possess the physical and electrical characteristics of the industry necessary to simulate real behavior. With this development, people in training will be able to connect PLCs to the industrial virtual laboratory by Modbus/TCP communication and program complex automation sequences in real industrial scenarios which have been virtualized. This means they will be able to modify the parameters and the sequences of control without the risk of compromising the safety of the process or personnel involved.","Escenarios Virtuales, Automatización, virtual labs, automation",0,1,0,1

Power electronics converters (PECs) are widely used to provide power processing for applications ranging from communications and medical electronics to motor drives, power conversion and high-power transmission, making them one of the most important topics for power electronics engineering. This paper presents an educational graphical user interface (GUI) for simulation of various topologies of PECs which students can use to explore the behaviour of PECs. The GUI is developed by using Matlab/Simulink, SimPowerSystems and the GUIDE tool of MATLAB, which acts as a front-end interface that can be used for teaching as well as learning. The positive response from students indicates that the comprehensive GUI package is extremely useful for power electronics courses. The package can be considered as a virtual laboratory or as a useful learning tool for the power community.","Power electronics converters, Power electronics education, SimPowerSystems, Simulink",0,1,0,1

10.1038/npre.2011.6066.1,Collaborative platforms for streamlining workflows in Open Science,Nature Precedings,2011,Article,"Despite the internet’s dynamic and collaborative nature, scientists continue to produce grant proposals, lab notebooks, data files, conclusions etc. that stay in static formats or are not published online and therefore not always easily accessible to the interested public. Because of limited adoption of tools that seamlessly integrate all aspects of a research project (conception, data generation, data evaluation, peer-reviewing and publishing of conclusions), much effort is later spent on reproducing or reformatting individual entities before they can be repurposed independently or as parts of articles.We propose that workflows - performed both individually and collaboratively - could potentially become more efficient if all steps of the research cycle were coherently represented online and the underlying data were formatted, annotated and licensed for reuse. Such a system would accelerate the process of taking projects from conception to publication stages and allow for continuous updating of the data sets and their interpretation as well as their integration into other independent projects.A major advantage of such workflows is the increased transparency, both with respect to the scientific process as to the contribution of each participant. The latter point is important from a perspective of motivation, as it enables the allocation of reputation, which creates incentives for scientists to contribute to projects. Such workflow platforms offering possibilities to fine-tune the accessibility of their content could gradually pave the path from the current static mode of research presentation into a more coherent practice of open science.","virtual research environments, collaboratories, workflow platform, automation, transparency, reproducibitliy, reputation, funding, open science, Open Hardware",0,0,1,1
