However, to support learners in effective leaning through construction processes, it is necessary to provide appropriate support to the learners according to their skills or knowledge. We have developed a Web-based interactive virtual laboratory with a construction kit, where users can assemble primitive components into a biker model powered by a solar cell. In this paper, we have proposed auto-connection mechanisms for supporting different types of users and different learning scenarios in the laboratory. Since this auto-connection setting can be changed during runtime by users according to the learners' skills, teachers can provide different settings for each learner without resorting to complicated programming.","computer-aided instruction, education, virtual instrumentation auto connection mechanisms, educational virtual laboratory, educational tools, Web-based interactive virtual laboratory, solar cell",0,1,0,1

The Visible Thinking pedagogical framework is also suggested to achieve a good complement to traditional lecture-tutorial systems. The virtual laboratory is implemented in an open-access Java interactive software. We demonstrate a viable instruction procedure, providing a set of virtual laboratory activities with real-world applications spanning signal processing, data science and analytics, sustainable infrastructure engineering, and theoretical physics. A preliminary study on a pilot cohort indicates that the proposed virtual laboratory can enhance students' learning.

10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2978089,Research on Multimodal Perceptual Navigational Virtual and Real Fusion Intelligent Experiment Equipment and Algorithm,IEEE Access,2020,Article,"Virtual experiment is an important field of human-computer interaction. With more and more virtual laboratories emerging, we found that problems regarding virtual experiments are rising. Such problems can be listed as follows: First, human-computer interaction has lower efficiency during the process of virtual experiment, which means the computer cannot understand the user's intention thus leading to incorrect operation. Second, there are less detections for false behavior during experiments. Third, the virtual laboratory's sense of operation and realism is not strong. In order to solve the above problems, the multimodal sensing navigation virtual and real fusion laboratory (MSNVRFL) was designed and implemented in this paper. We design a new set of experimental equipment with the function of cognition and study a multimodal fusion model and algorithm for chemical experiments, which are both finally verified and applied in MSNVRFL. By using multimodal fusion perception algorithm, the user's true intentions can be understood and the human-computer interaction efficiency can be improved. By carrying out a virtual experiment with the mold of virtual and real fusion, problems like resources wasting and dangers happened during experiment can be avoided, user's sense of operation and realism can be improved. In addition, teaching navigation and wrong operation behavior reminders are provided for users. The experimental result shows that our method can improve the efficiency of human-computer interaction, reduce the user's cognitive load, strengthen the user's sense of reality and operation and stimulate students' interest in learning. © 2013 IEEE.","human-computer interaction, intelligent teaching, Multimodal fusion, virtual experiments",0,1,0,1
10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025229,A Design of Smart Beaker Structure and Interaction Paradigm Based on Multimodal Fusion Understanding,IEEE Access,2020,Article,"Virtual chemistry experiment is an important teaching tool in middle schools. It can not only help students understand the experimental principles, but also help them memorize the experimental procedures. However, there are still some problems in virtual chemistry experiments. First, in existing research, user intentions are often misunderstood and cannot be accurately understood. Second, the existing research fail to identify the user's wrong actions, which reduce the accuracy of the experiment. Third, the user sense of operation and realism is not strong during the experiment, which reduces the user's experience. Finally, the lack of navigation guidance for experimental operations increases user learning time. In order to solve these problems. This paper proposes a scheme for establishing an intelligent navigational chemical laboratory based on multimodal fusion. First of all, we design a new smart beaker structure with perceptual ability, which can be used to complete most chemical experiments and give users a real sense of experience. Besides, we propose a multimodal fusion understanding algorithm, which reduces the misidentification of the experiment and better understands the real intention of the user. Finally, intelligent navigation and wrong behavior recognition functions are added to the experimental equipment, which improves the efficiency of human-computer interaction. The results show that Compared with the existing virtual laboratory or system, the chemical laboratory scheme proposed in this paper through multimodal fusion understanding algorithm greatly reduces the user's memory load and improves the success rate of the experiment. Moreover, through the combination of virtual and real, the virtual chemistry experiment not only improves the authenticity of the operation, but also stimulates the students' interest in learning, which is well received by users. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Remote and virtual laboratories can be a solution to improve this design in distance methodology. This fact has been more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences with respect to education. Its transparent integration into the learning process and the inclusion of learning analytic features are essential features of these kinds of technologies. Without them, lecturers cannot track the performance and the satisfaction of their students. Our LoT@UNED (Laboratory-of-Things@UNED) platform has been implemented to include all these educational features for IoT environments, ranging from edge to cloud computing. Taking the advantages of the IoT paradigm, this platform involves acquiring practical competences within IoT and edge-cloud programming topics, among others. Furthermore, its flexibility allows us to host other areas, such as cybersecurity. Specifically, our platform incorporates a set of sustainable capabilities (scalability, availability, and security), so contributing to the SDG 4 challenge with a low-complex and efficient solution for quality distance education. To analyze the impact of our proposed solution, this work also focuses on studying the influence among several acceptance UTAUT/TAM factors during the students’ learning and teaching process. To achieve this goal, both exploratory and confirmatory analyses have been conducted. The reliability and validity of data are also analyzed. An improved structural equation model has also been studied, satisfying several statistical indicators according to the recommended thresholds in the current literature. The usefulness of our platform, easing the users’ attitude and having a high availability of resources affect positively the intention of use our IoT cloud solution and, as a consequence, the great quality of the education process. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

10.1109/AERO.2017.7943855,NSF GENI cloud enabled architecture for distributed scientific computing,IEEE Aerospace Conference,2017,Conference Paper,"GENI (Global Environment for Network Innovations) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded program which provides a virtual laboratory for networking and distributed systems research and education. It is well suited for exploring networks at a scale, thereby promoting innovations in network science, security, services and applications. GENI allows researchers obtain compute resources from locations around the United States, connect compute resources using 100G Internet2 L2 service, install custom software or even custom operating systems on these compute resources, control how network switches in their experiment handle traffic flows, and run their own L3 and above protocols. GENI architecture incorporates cloud federation. With the federation, cloud resources can be federated and/or community of clouds can be formed. The heart of federation is user identity and an ability to ""advertise"" cloud resources into community including compute, storage, and networking. GENI administrators can carve out what resources are available to the community and hence a portion of GENI resources are reserved for internal consumption. GENI architecture also provides ""stitching"" of compute and storage resources researchers request. This provides L2 network domain over Internet2's 100G network. And researchers can run their Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers on the provisioned L2 network domain for a complete control of networking traffic. This capability is useful for large science data transfer (bypassing security devices for high throughput). Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), a research institute in the state of North Carolina, has developed ORCA (Open Resource Control Architecture), a GENI control framework. ORCA is a distributed resource orchestration system to serve science experiments. ORCA provides compute resources as virtual machines and as well as baremetals. ORCA based GENI rack was designed to serve both High Throughput Computing (HTC) and High Performance Computing (HPC) type of computes. Although, GENI is primarily used in various universities and research entities today, GENI architecture can be leveraged in the commercial, aerospace and government settings. This paper will go over the architecture of GENI and discuss the GENI architecture for scientific computing experiments. © 2017 IEEE.","Computer architecture, servers, cloud computing, Hardware, Fabrics, Blades",0,1,0,1

MMCVL addresses the problems faced by the current education system such as lack of resources and safe use of expensive laboratory equipment. It also provides a means for easy collaboration between students and teachers from different universities and schools. Multimedia data in terms of 3D mesh, skeleton, audio and virtual object physics interaction are incorporated in MMCVL to provide a 3D Tele-Immersion environment. The system uses low-cost RGB-D cameras such as Microsoft Kinect V2 to capture and generate 3D model of the person by extracting him/her from the entire captured data and immersing it in different interactive virtual environments. Different lab environments can be virtually created to provide for and replace the real laboratories. Object interactions allow for users to interact with the virtual objects present in the scene similar to real lab setup. Recording module of the toolkit allows future reference for training and testing of the student. The system also facilitates virtual feedback by giving the correct measurements, video demonstrations as well as audio communication with the collaborating teacher.

The system supports hands-on e-learning experiences with robotics and automation, performed via internet. It allows the learners to access and solve 'problems', submit their solutions and have them evaluated. The problems are defined by the teacher, also specifying instructional aspects, such as the learner's skills involved in producing a solution. For each individual learner a personal Student Model is maintained, recording learner's knowledge and skills, as shown by the solved problems. The access to the problem is guarded by the system, ensuring that the problems can all be 'seen' by any student, whereas a learner can work on a problem only if its prerequisites are covered, or anyway 'not too far' from her current competences. The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results. © 2017 IEEE.","Adaptivity, e-learning, Robot Control, Teleoperation, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Both types of learning resources can easily be shared between universities or industrial partners, leading to dramatic reductions in the costs associated with development, construction, operation and maintenance of traditional laboratory set-ups; however, each is characterised by inherent advantages and disadvantages. We compare and contrast remote experiments and virtual labs, using two case studies: 'Cambridge Weblab', a remote experiment built by the Computational Modeling (CoMo) Group at the University of Cambridge and 'SRM web-suite', a virtual lab developed by CMCL innovations. The Cambridge Weblab remote experiment uses a Siemens SIMATIC PS7 industrial interface to control a chemical reactor, yielding authentic experiences of industrial practices for students. A variety of pedagogical approaches employed by institutions using the Weblab are also discussed in this paper. The SRM web-suite uses an advanced engine design tool that simulates fuels, combustion and emissions in conventional and advanced internal combustion engines. The detailed simulations have been precisely tailored for training and educational settings. The web-suite labs provide students and engineering professionals with experience using the latest industry-standard technology, whilst supporting a wide range of educational goals e.g. undergraduate courses in combustion engines or chemical reaction engineering and advanced courses in futuristic fuels or powertrain engineering.

In an attempt to overcome the aforementioned issue, this paper discusses an ethical educational platform, called DoS-VLab, that aims at allowing students experience common denial of service (DoS) attacks, in secure academic environment. DoS-VLab platform is based on virtualization technologies and GNS3 network simulator for building virtual networks. Compared to traditional physical laboratories, practices show that the DoS-VLab platform helped produce more lab practices within the students, reduced training hours required for implementing hands-on lab exercises, and resulted in higher completion rate of the hands-on lab exercises. © 2016 IEEE.","Denial of Service attacks, Ethical hacking, Hands-on lab exercises, Information security education, Virtualization technologies",0,1,0,1

These difficulties are linked to several economic, material and human factors. Thus, this paper first proposes to study a model of laboratories for online practical work applicable in several areas of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Then, for the practical implementation of the laboratory, the authors are interested in practical computer science work for development and network environments. The objective of this paper is therefore to implement a virtual laboratory that will allow students to create remote work in IT using the cloud to improve the performance, availability and scalability of existing practical work. The type of laboratory proposed is essentially based on virtual machines accessible via a web platform created and connected with the cloud that contains these virtual machines. It is also dynamic and flexible, i.e. the teacher, from this platform, first makes a request to the cloud administrator to create machines for a specific type of practical work for a group of students. Then, the teacher places in the platform the instructions of the practical work visible to the students. At this stage, the students will connect to the platform for the realization of the practical work with virtual machines following the instructions given by the teacher. The teacher's monitoring and supervision of the practical work in synchronous or asynchronous mode is also ensured.

Numerical calculations may show these quantities, but students cannot carry them out for themselves. Therefore, a virtual environment for fluid mechanics is created with the software UNREAL ENGINE 4.

However, the demand is not being fulfilled, partially due to the inability of educational institutions to keep up with technological advancements, as well as a lack of hands-on educational material. We have been developing portable virtual lab modules which can be used to teach basic cloud computing concepts and skills early and often. The labs run on virtual machines and can be ported between different courses and between different platforms. The virtual labs can be deployed in centralized or decentralized ways. To meet the learning outcomes, the students are expected to: 1) comprehend the fundamental concepts of cloud computing; 2) identify the building blocks of cloud computing systems; 3) understand the basic operation of open source cloud infrastructures; and 4) recognize commonly used, commercial cloud computing services and applications. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud computing, online education, virtual laboratory, virtualization",0,1,0,1
10.1109/FIE.2013.6684994,Online laboratories as a cloud service developed by students,IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference,2013,Conference Paper,"On-line laboratories (virtual or remote) are widely used in experimental engineering subjects as part of the learning process. In order to develop these laboratories, a development framework called RELATED (Remote Laboratories exTendED) is used by the Communications and Control System Department of the Spanish University for Distance Education of Spain (UNED). This framework defines a structured and methodological development procedure, allowing the students the generation of their own laboratories. Once the laboratory is developed (based in its components), students have to configure their own computing resources in order to make their labs available. However, several problems must be faced by students in the ""deployment"" of their labs: network configuration, hardware availability, and so on. So, in order to solve these problems, an automatic system based on cloud providers is defined to allow students having their own cloud network/resources for their developed labs. This system simplifies the lab deployment and avoids common errors/mistakes in the development of laboratories with RELATED. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud service model, Development, Laboratory deployment, Remote virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

Therefore, curricula of Biomedical Engineering (BME) courses include cardiac electrophysiology. This paper describes a virtual laboratory designed for the study of the generation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) based on cellular electrophysiology. In detail, the virtual lab includes (1) an equivalent source model for cardiac cells, (2) a formulation of the mathematical relationship between the transmembrane potential and the transmembrane current, (3) the determination of resulting extracellular potentials, and (4) the calculation of the ECG by a weighted summation of transmembrane currents. Since these tasks require specific presumption and knowledge concerning cardiac geometry, a geometrical model was constructed using anatomical stylized segments of the left ventricle. Propagation parameters control the activation sequence as well as velocity and direction for anisotropic conduction. In order to verify the developed models and algorithms simulation results were compared against experimentally obtained data under various physiological conditions. Although there is considerable scatter in the measurements, the comparison indicates that a definite relationship exists between measured and computed waveforms. Simulations interactively show physiological and pathophysiological changes in the ECGs for various user setting of the cell function. In conclusion, the interactive laboratory enables the user to study the relationship between the electric activity of cardiac cells and the resulting extracellular potentials including the ECGs on the body surface. Students increase their knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology, applied electrical circuit theory and the understanding of differential equations as well as numerical methods for solving them. © 2013 IEEE.","biomedical engineering, Electrocardiogram, Heart model, simulations, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

In this paper, based on the analysis of the experiments features of computer science curricula, such as, Principle of Computer Organization, Digital Image Process, Digital Signal Process etc., we design two kinds of virtual lab platforms and develop corresponding virtual lab systems for the courses in computer science curricula. In the first virtual lab, every experiment instrument in real lab is visualized as a Java component. In the other kind of virtual lab, the algorithm students learn in the course is packed as a Web Service component by C, C++ or Java. In both platforms, those components are listed in the system. Students is able to select Java components or Web Service components as the experiment they want to do need and integrate them by building connections between them. Then, the students can set input for the experiment in the input component. After click the button of rum, the result will be display for the students in the platform. In the two kinds of virtual lab, students can also write the code in the platform. After it is submitted, those codes will be transferred as a component by the platform and be added in the component list. Then they can use them as the components provide by the platform. So, they can test if the algorithm they write is correct. Both platforms are developed by Java Applet and can be run by a browse. By using our system, students can experiment at any time and any place via the Internet. Teacher is also able to do experiment in the classroom.

Also, the classes held in didactic laboratories enhance the learning ability of the students, because they help the understanding of the subject matter. There are also reports stating that students feel more motivated to learn Chemistry when they make use of practical and dynamic classes. However, the availability of laboratories to carry out practical activities is difficult to found in different levels of education in several countries. This paper assumes that the expansion of resources to increase the experimental practice of Chemistry can be achieved by developing virtual laboratories in a way of helping them to get involved in active learning. In this work a virtual laboratory, called VirtuaLabQ, with predefined experiments about Chemical Transformations is introduced. Also, a case study that shows the use of VirtuaLabQ integrated to hands-on laboratory is presented. The case study was performed with Engineering undergraduate students that attend the Chemical Transformation course. The main target of this study was to investigate if practicing the experiments previously in VirtuaLabQ improves the students' performance in experiments accomplished in a hands-on chemistry laboratory. Two sets of laboratory experiments were conducted, in wich students first performed online activities in VirtuaLabQ and after in the hands-on laboratory, during regular class time. Also, students answered questionnaires evaluating the performance of each experiment in virtual and hands-on laboratory. Four questions were chosen to be analyzed in order to check the main target of this work. Results indicate that the integration of virtual and hands-on experiments in a Chemistry undergraduate course assists in the good performance of students in a hands-on laboratory and can contribute to the improvement of student learning. However, improvements in VirtuaLabQ and new case studies are necessary to confirm these findings, considering, for example, other kind of evaluations that effectively compare student performance besides self-evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.","blended learning, Chemistry education, hands-on laboratory, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Teaching engineering classes online during the pandemic has shown us the values of in-person interaction and the versatility of information that can be conveyed in physical classrooms. Many types of teaching strategies, such as physical demonstrations and in-class activities, are more accessible in-person compared to virtual sessions. To address this issue, we introduce two virtual lab modules with (a) pre-recorded and (b) real-time models that provide platforms for virtual mechanical tensile testing and a remote photon quantum entanglement experiment, respectively. The first virtual lab platform was built from a host of recorded mechanical tests on several engineering materials samples. After choosing the experiment/material, students can simultaneously view the data acquisition and the video of the test in detail. The numerical raw data set for each specimen is accessible after completion of each experiment in form of a spreadsheet. The introduction of the virtual lab has allowed us to add interactive elements to solid mechanics and machine design classes. For the second virtual laboratory module, we present a real time lab platform, where the participating students can perform experiments and collect data in real time by accessing the lab setup remotely. The general concept of the real time virtual lab is based on a human-in-the-loop control system that allows a user to operate an actuator remotely. To feature this real-time approach to virtual laboratory, we selected photon quantum entanglement experiments as part of mechatronics class. The early results, drawn from the students' feedback, demonstrate the promising outcomes of the virtual lab platforms for students learning and instructor-student interaction. Participating students expressed high level of connection to the classes and conceptual grasp of the course topics.

In universities, such learning pedagogies are commonly accomplished through laboratory experiments. With the rapid rate of the development of new technologies, integration of industry practices, as well as simulation of industry environment, has never been more necessary. However, lack of facilities, equipment and laboratory space has been a major constraint of universities in the country. This is evident in Bulacan State University, which houses 5000 students in College of Engineering alone, distributed in eight (8) courses. Maintenance and management of laboratory equipment has also been problematic due to the vast number of lecturers and students that uses these facilities. In this paper, virtual reality is utilized in the development of laboratory simulations for pneumatics. Research and interview was conducted in order for the researchers to be familiar with the laboratory experiments performed in pneumatic courses. Rendering of the pneumatic components were done through Blender. Unity was used to develop the virtual reality environment. The researchers were able to create a simple experiment on a single-acting cylinder operated by a pneumatic switch. The experiment included the full use of the Vive gear, wherein the students are in a completely immersive 3D virtual reality environment, which included the use of controllers to simulate the actual environment.

Natural phenomenon affects the real world measurement and control the working algorithm. However, equipping a laboratory ubiquitously is an effective in cost and its maintenance can be difficult. Teaching assistants are required to instruct and setting up the well equipped laboratory, and grade the student report. These time-consuming and costly tasks turns in relatively low equipped laboratory also when teaching assistants and laboratory equipment are available experiments can be driven out.

This paper discusses how volumetric visualization and 3D scanning can be integrated with cadaveric dissection to deliver benefits in the key areas of clinician-patient communication and medical education. The specific area of medical application is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder - iliotibial (IT) band syndrome. By combining knowledge from cadaveric dissection and volumetric visualization, a virtual laboratory was created using the Unity 3D game engine, as an interactive education tool for use in various settings. The system is designed to improve the experience of clinicians who had commented that their earlier training would have been enhanced by key features of the system, including accurate three-dimensional models generated from computed tomography, high resolution cryosection images of the Visible Human dataset, and surface anatomy generated from a white light scan of an athlete. The finding from the virtual laboratory concept is that knowledge gained through dissection helps enhance the value of the model by incorporating more detail of the distal attachments of the IT band.

For example, design code asked designers/students to make distribution of re-bars for several numbers rather than one re-bar in the designed beam. Students can estimate the total amount of reinforcement cross sectional area by simple calculation, but students have to distribute the total amount area of re-bars to several numbers of re-bars with small diameter. In this requirement of the code, the students who learn RC structure design at the beginning stage are not easy to understand from theoretical point of view. However, they can easily learn, if they have hands on experience like real experiments or numerical simulations. Here, the real experiments for RC structures are required a lot of time and cost. Therefore, if a realistic simulation tool, so-called 'Virtual RC Structure Lab', is provided for engineering educational purpose, students could have a chance to learn from virtual hands on experience for RC structure design. © 2015 IEEE.","failure behavior, hands on experience learning, RC structures, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

However, no one has developed a smart virtual laboratory (VL) that can follow the capabilities of its personalized users. This study intends to develop a smart VL that is implemented in student practices of electric machines. Students can use this VL according to the achievement of their theoretical abilities of electric machines' practicum. This smart VL is called VLC-UM. VLC-UM uses an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm (backward chaining) to determine the ability of students who will take practicum material. Whereas to determine the practicum modules that will be accessed and used by students, the algorithm used is forward chaining. Machine learning is used to classify the learning materials according to the students' ability. The findings from the testing results on the Virtual Laboratory state that the accuracy of determining the appropriate module for users is 80% and the determination of the appropriate category based on the user's ability is 90%. © 2019 IEEE.","artificial intelligence, Industry 4.0, machine learning, virtual laboratory, Web programming",0,1,0,1

One of these new opportunities is the possibility to access and use computers and equipment remotely. This paradigm can be used for many different purposes-from education and research to management and business tasks. With the increased need for remote access technologies, the establishment of remote access networks is also on the rise. Such networks provide the possibility to establish remote and virtual laboratories, which can be accessed from the Internet. The goal of the virtual laboratories is to provide users with software that simulates and emulates real networks, devices and equipment. This type of laboratories enables the students to practice their skills before using real equipment. Remote laboratories, on the other hand, provide a virtual interface to a real devices. The remote access laboratories are providing the students with a realistic view of the system behavior and are allowing them access to professional tools from anywhere and whenever they need. With the help of the remote laboratories, institutions without access to professional equipment, can run experiments and access specific tools from any location. In this paper we will investigate the process of establishing and using one such remote access laboratory- A laboratory for wireless networks and technologies. The lab setup consists of a remotely accessed computer, a wireless spectrum analyzer and a signal generator. This set of devices provides possibilities for analysis of various modulation techniques, as well as other specific characteristics of the wireless communication systems and devices. In order to extend the functionality of the laboratory set of wireless routers and a group of wireless sensor nodes is added. The wireless routers would provide the possibility to study one of the most widely used family of communication standards-the IEEE 802.11. The wireless sensor networks are currently also very attractive as a research area and are becoming even more widely used.

Learning in a 3D environment allows greater interaction with contents in a unique way as students perceive it as being really there. Simulations are being designed, a combination of real-world environment with the information supplied by devices, where measurements can be replicated and data analyzed. This study presents a virtual scenario of a Measurements and Instrumentation laboratory.Electrical Engineering courses aim to train students to succeed in meeting the challenges within competitive and everchanging professional contexts. In order to prepare undergraduate students for ongoing success, the courses must provide effective training in the application and development of practices, typically implemented in large projects and organizations. Developing high quality engineering course units is definitely a challenging task. Courses can be provided remotely, but careful planning is required to design quality course units because problems may occur in meeting quality targets. The developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), including multimedia and internet-based education platforms, facilitate the creation of reliable solutions to these challenges. Studies show that a smart application of multimedia technologies and webbased education platforms can provide great results towards better quality of engineering courses. Many challenges on how to suitably approach the educational process have already been put forward. Higher Education institutions use multiple approaches to teaching and learning, combining a range of methods, including e-learning, videoconferencing, face-to-face teaching and hard-copy resources in course delivery. The authors present a software model for engineering, which is based mainly on the Wirefusion<sup>®</sup> software, and a virtualreality platform called VEMA. The project intends to improve the quality of teaching and learning in higher education through effective application of information technologies and the sciences of learning. 3D virtual learning environments arise as solutions to the extent that, in addition to offering features associated with communication and information sharing, they promote flexible learning spaces and moments. At the level of higher education, and in accordance with the paradigm of Bologna, virtual environments acquire special importance to allow learning beyond the classroom time and space.","Three-dimensional displays, Solid modeling, Electronic learning, Rendering (computer graphics), computational modeling, Internet, e-learning, interactive application, software packages, training and education, virtual reality prototype, 3D lab internet",0,1,0,1

SDN as a technology provides a high level of abstraction by decoupling the control plane from the data plane giving the ability to network administrators and operators to 'program' the network in much the same way as ordinary computer programmers write their programs in high level language such as Python, PHP, C++, C# and other. All of the network programming is carried out onto a centralized computer called a SDN controller, which connects to the data plane (hardware devices) via open standard protocols such as OpenFlow. The ever growing user demands regarding the networks and its underlying structure plays a key role in the adoption of SDN technology. Even though SDN is in its early days of development it has undergone a lot of changes during the past few years. This leads us to believe that this technology is going to be implemented into real world networks in the near future.

The exposure to limitless information and experiences has completely modified their view of the world in ways unfamiliar to other generations.

One way of enhancing the learning experience is to be aware of the current attitudes and behaviors of today's students and to rely more and more on the technological improvements in educational strategies. Goal oriented and intellectually inquisitive students prefer experimental activities, which are structured, involve teamwork and virtual collaboration instead of simple narrations and monologues.

10.1109/REM.2019.8744115,A Novel Design of Virtual Laboratory,International Conference on Research and Education in Mechatronics,2019,Conference Paper,"The rapid growth of the manufacturing, automotive, robotics, and smart-grid industries will require engineers that posses attributes related to multidisciplinary formation and strong tools to design solutions to complex problems. The engineer's formation requires to include the development of multidisciplinary abilities into their programs and backing the theory with real-world practice. In this sense, specialized laboratories are necessary in order to carry out this kind of formation and training. However, the lack of specialized laboratories is one of the main obstacles preventing us from reaching this objective. The specialized laboratories require specialized installation, maintenance and cost management as well as a design that can accommodate a large number of students. In contrast, the virtual laboratories are one tool that can be used to deal with both issues which are the lack of specialized engineers and the absence of specialized laboratories. This work proposes a new design of a virtual laboratory in order to specialize engineers in several fields such as power electronics, electric machines, automatic control, and information and computational technologies. The laboratory proposed includes tools such as co-simulation, co-modeling, and co-design in order to face complex problems within the industry. © 2019 IEEE.","Co-design, Co-modelling, Co-simulation, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

In such cases, the users can check their designs using simulation but it does not give a feel of running their designs on the actual system. So a remote triggered system allows the user to test their designs on high end FPGA kits. The remote system asks the user to provide the design file and the test vectors and the system abstracts the tasks of compiling, synthesizing, pin assignment etc as these are automated at the remote FPGA's end or the server end. Thus, the users' work is further simplified. Hence the name, Remote Triggered FPGA based Automated System.

However, still today those laboratories which require relatively advanced graphics (3D or even 2D graphics) often rely on non-standard components and browser plugins, such as Adobe Flash or Java Applets. These components were necessary because of the severe limitations that standard Web technologies have traditionally had in regard to graphics and RIAs (Rich Internet Applications). This paper analyzes two of the most common non-standard technologies that are still used today in remote laboratories. It also proposes two alternatives which make use of modern Web technologies (Canvas and WebGL). Additionally, it illustrates one of the proposed alternatives (WebGL) with an example: Weblab-FPGA-Watertank, a hybrid laboratory implemented at the University of Deusto under the Weblab-Deusto RLMS (Remote Laboratory Management System), which lets users program a real FPGA device remotely to control a virtual environment. Users require only an up-to-date browser and require no plugins whatsoever. The fully-featured virtual environment is rendered through WebGL.

High costs associated with equipment, space, and maintenance staff, impose certain constraints on resources for traditional laboratories. While, Virtual and Remote Laboratories can overcome these limitations, they present important limitations in their use. Some actions are repetitive in nature, cannot be executed trivially or in reasonable time by a user. Some others might be simply impossible without computer help. For example, doing a linear regression of values obtained in an experiment, performing a comparison of results obtained by making a sweep in the values of a particular variable or taking a system to an initial state. Hence, it arises the need of encoding some experimental tasks to automatize their execution. With other existing applications, to encode experiments, users need to know how VRLs are implemented. In addition, they have to manage the language in which the simulation was created so they need to handle fluently a simulation language just to perform experiments. The authors propose a tool called the Experiment Editor, to undertake automated experiments for VRLs. The Experiment Editor enables the user to encode experiments regardless of the language in which the laboratory was implemented. To do so, it provides a powerful and easy-to-learn language, and the corresponding interpreter that supports the execution of the experiments. © 2016 IEEE.","Easy Java(script) Simulations, experimentation language, experiments, remote laboratories, simulations, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

This applies in particular when short time-to-market constraints impose serious limitations on the exploration of the design space. The use of virtual platforms can help in decreasing the development cycles. In this paper, we present a cloud-based environment allowing the design of virtual platforms and prototyping of the system including complex software with prerecorded data or testbenches. Afterwards, the created design can also be synthesized for Xilinx FPGAs. Additionally, this paper presents the use of this remote virtual prototyping environment in a hardware-related programming laboratory with more than 350 participating undergraduate students. This large number of attendees leads to a lot of issues regarding the supervisory relationship as well as providing enough hardware resources in terms of boards. Nevertheless, we want to give the students hands-on experience when programming an embedded system on an FPGA-board. The cloud-based infrastructure allows us to respond to these difficulties by implementing a Software-in-the-Loop simulation based on an instruction set simulator. Doing so the students can design and implement their codes for the targeted architecture and prototype and debug it on a virtual platform.

To provide affordable virtual laboratories to these engineering colleges, Government of India runs the Virtual Labs project with a select set of participating institutions to create virtual labs required for entire engineering student population of India. The program suffers from two problems: 1) lack of focus on pedagogy and learnability of labs being created, and 2) little ability to scale to more teachers and subject matter experts to produce labs aligned to local contexts. This paper presents a model (LEAD model) for the design of virtual labs for a data structures and algorithms course in computer science and is intended to address the problems stated above. The model encodes the principles of learning in the design and structure of an experiment so that labs can be learnable by design. The model is based on constructivist theory of learning. It uses Bloom's Taxonomy for defining learning objectives and applies Merrill's first principles and Gagne's 9 events of instruction as instructional design methodologies. To ensure tasks in an experiment indeed aid learning, the model requires a mapping between tasks and learning principles to be created and published along with the experiment. The model uses a pedagogy that lays strong emphasis on conceptual understanding without the use of code or program. To demonstrate the efficacy of this model, we present the data analysis of the feedback from early users of one the experiments. Even though limited in scope, data shows that experiments built using LEAD model can aid understanding for the students. © 2019 IEEE.","algorithms, bloom's taxonomy, constructivist, data structures, gagne's 9 events of instruction, India, merrill's principles of instruction, undergraduate engineering, virtual labs",0,1,0,1

Some professors from the University of Jaen, Spain, have wide experience in the field of didactic resources for renewable energies subjects teaching. The use of solar energy in order to obtain electricity is called solar energy photovoltaic. This transformation is possible due to the photovoltaic effect. To design a photovoltaic system in any location it is essential to know the exact amount of solar resource available in the area. For this purpose, collecting data on solar radiation becomes crucial. Currently, there exist databases where we can find information on solar radiation but only for horizontal surfaces (known as global solar irradiance on horizontal surfaces). After this, by applying really complex mathematical equations and algorithms, it is possible to obtain solar radiation data for non-horizontal surfaces. In the present work a virtual laboratory which we developed by us is explained.

Moreover, LABEL makes it easy to analyze the singularities that appear in the solution of the inverse and direct kinematic problem. These singularities are analyzed through the use of a path planning application, which allows the user to plan a trajectory in the robot's workspace.

Although virtual laboratories have drawn increasing research attention in the last decade, wiring practice, which is a crucial part of experimentation, is normally neglected. In this paper, a practice including 3-D modeling, HTML5-based rendering, and control algorithm design is implemented for the interactive virtual wiring based on the Networked Control System Laboratory (NCSLab) framework. The wiring practice is combined with control algorithm design, which is already realized in NCSLab, where users are allowed to customize algorithms using MATLAB/Simulink real-time workshop. Apart from remotely implementing the control algorithm, the 3-D virtual wiring process must be completed correctly before the online experiments can proceed properly. The proposed wiring laboratory is evaluated in practical teaching, with both students' performance and perception considered. The conclusions derived from the report show that the 3-D virtual wiring interactions make virtual experimentation complete for simulating a real case, as well as providing an opportunity for a clearer comprehension of control systems. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","3-D virtual wiring, HTML5, online laboratories, virtual experimentation",0,1,0,1

10.1109/UPEC.2013.6715005,Electrical engineering teaching and distance learning using a desktop virtual reality system,Universities Power Engineering Conference,2013,Conference Paper,"Higher education has evolved in the last decade with the use of information technology. This change was called distance education, a teaching method in which the student does not need to meet with the teacher on a certain day and time. The student may be either at home or at work and may have no interaction with the other parts, either the teacher or other students. It has allowed the institutions to resolve geographical gaps in order to reach the largest number of students. On the other hand, it paved the way for the 'non-traditional' universities oriented for 'adult work', in a narrow range of graduation programs, compatible with the current demands from industry. It is also important to mention that distance education is becoming increasingly appropriate for non-academic studies, such as corporate training environments. This paper addresses Circuit Theory systems, more specifically laboratory practices geared towards teaching and learning. The choice was made from observing the needs in the specific context of a measures and instrumentation laboratory, mainly related with access to the means and equipment to carry out laboratory practice. The purpose of the work is the use of virtual experimentation to carry out laboratory practice and also as an alternative tool to meet the needs of access to the means and equipment of the laboratory. In the present case, the basis of the project was the construction of a 3D lab environment (Measures and Instrumentation) where the equipment and the components can be seen and manipulated. The project involves simple electrical schematics, which later can be changed in values, presenting new results, and displays a set of menus and submenus to support experiments. The virtual laboratory can accommodate new devices and scenarios, being adapted to new subjects, such as electric machines and power system analysis of the Electrical Engineering program. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop VR prototype, 'Virtual Electric Manual' - VEMA, can be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment. Several interactive scenes were developed to illustrate the idea using a measurements and instrumentation laboratory as virtual environment. The added value of these various features in the educational context is that they contribute to the construction of new virtual environments, able to benefit the communication between teachers and students and among themselves, thus creating new opportunities for each student to participate more actively in his/her own learning construction process. Rather than being seen as mere information files, these e-learning platforms should be perceived as a means to promote interaction and experimentation through technological resources. © 2013 IEEE.","electrical engineering, Teaching and Distance Learning, Virtual Reality System",0,1,0,1

The learning of the basic concepts of circuit theory, the type of concepts and the form of experimentation, traditionally acquired in educational laboratories, are fundamental and demand new and better tools. The teaching of electric circuit analysis requires students to compare theory and practice of 'learning by doing', using physical or virtual didactic benches. Virtual learning environments (VLE) allow the organization of more controlled courses, combining classroom and distance lessons, the use of only virtual classes, new possibilities of interaction over the internet, and a closer interaction between teachers and students. The goal of this project was to provide a virtual environment where students can learn and experiment electrical concepts in a user-friendly environment. The software used for this project was Autodesk® 3DS Max, VizUp, Wirefusion and Dreamweaver. An experimental model was designed, which provides the necessary simulations as well as a variety of configurations, to be used as part of the learning process. This prototype of a virtual lab, referred to as VEMA (Virtual Electric MAnual), was developed at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC/DEE) to teach circuit theory. The aim of this prototype is the development of three-dimensional replicas of real electrical systems, so that the electrical components can be moved virtually, enabling an easy handling and control of lessons and educational activities in a virtual form.

At many universities, undergraduate curricula include systems and control courses with dynamic modelling and simulations in their syllabi. In order to design a controller for a physical system, one has to know the operational behaviors of that system very well so that a proper controller could be designed. Keeping this in mind, educational computer-aided software with a user-friendly visual interface was developed. The software provides an opportunity for students to simulate physical systems without and with the controllers they designed. Since it was developed to accompany undergraduate control system courses, the main purpose of this software was to create an interactive, practical, visual, and functional environment for the students who taking ACS courses. Therefore, it was called as virtual control laboratory (VCL). Basically, the students were able to design and simulate classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers and fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Besides, any other type of compensator with a transfer function or a state space model can be also combined with the physical system model for simulation and analysis. A laboratory type scope with two input channels was embedded in VCL in order to visually see and analyze the simulation results in the time domain.

There is an urgent need for clean and renewable energy sources. However, most renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, have very high initial costs, especially when used as a principal source. Distributed power generation using solar and wind power provides an effective solution to reduce the dependency on conventional power generation and to increase the reliability and quality of power systems. A mixture of distributed energy generation systems and loads can then be connected to form a microgrid.

A new module comprising simulation assignments has recently been integrated into the course. Having added this module, it is now feasible to simultaneously harness the power of simulations for predicting results of material testing, and provide a virtual lab that can be easily deployed when necessary. The main goal is to assist students with the learning process. Students gain a deeper understanding of the material properties and the changes resulting from various testing procedures by simulating the influence of relevant parameters and using visualizations. The other goal is to familiarize students with modern computational tools for solving engineering problems. The significance of this approach is in using industrial software early in the curriculum, and helping fulfill the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Criterion 3 outcomes 1, 3, and 6. Students are also required to compare their simulation results with the experimental data and discuss the potential sources of variations. The objective is to improve students' critical skills and decision making in design problems. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","engineering education, FEA, simulations, virtual labs",0,1,0,1
10.1002/cae.22480,A development platform prototype for virtual laboratories,Computer Applications in Engineering Education,2021,Article,"Virtual laboratories provide a cost-efficient way for schools and universities to organize high-quality laboratory work in engineering disciplines. However, developing virtual labs is time-consuming and often comes with duplicated efforts in developing common features. This paper presents a development platform prototype for virtual laboratories (DPVL). It consists of multiple modules to meet the needs of developing virtual labs. Details of the platform module design and its implementation are explained. Finally, the case study about the development of a virtual gearbox lab demonstrates the functionality of DPVL and the process of applying it for corresponding development. To evaluate the performance of DPVL, a comparative study has been conducted by involving different developers to develop the same virtual lab with and without the support of DPVL. The results proved that the VL development effort can be greatly reduced by more than 60% both in development time consumed and the code size generated. Moreover, DPVL is further tested for its hardware compatibility by students who developed VL for different display hardware. However, the final user evaluation experiment conducted has verified that DPVL is well received by users in terms of its ease of development, user-friendliness, and usefulness. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","development platform, experimental teaching, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The method, called DYOVL (“Do Your Own Virtual Laboratory”), was applied, first experimentally and then on a regular basis, with gradual optimization during consecutive years, within the practical sessions of the mechanics course taught to students in automatic control and computers. An educational website, containing application examples and several downloadable resources, was recently developed, to assist teaching by the new method. The co-creative character of this process is manifold, as students work together with the teaching staff and with their team colleagues to program virtual laboratory applications or to suggest improvements for the existing ones. The method demonstrated favorable outcomes in terms of engagement, motivation, and inclusiveness, as well as a positive attitude of the students, shown both by pre- and during-COVID satisfaction surveys. To assist potentially interested academic staff in implementing this approach in their universities, detailed methodological guidance is provided. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC","co-creation, engineering education, mechanics, programming, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Digitalization of archaeological fragments provides an excellent research platform, useful to distant researchers. New experiential activities will be provided in the process of knowledge development, communication and sharing. All ages and levels of students make practical, effective use of the produced platform, where, using 3D models, they will study and recompose the past. The aim is to enrich the educational methods, so that they respond fully to sustainable economic and social development. The research presented is developed in two levels. The first creates digital laboratories, where students follow findings from revealing till exhibition. The second investigates the use of this platform as a management tool by professional users (archaeologists, historians, conservators) in order to elaborate fragments of objects or even the whole findings, without real contact. The project enables distant research and mainly the possibility to examine findings that may be lost in future. To meet the above objectives, high-accuracy digital copies and 3D models are of significant importance. The project investigates the potential of using a structured light scanner and image-based modeling. The multi-image techniques using images of findings taken from different angles, distances, level of illumination, create a dense point cloud in 3D space and develop an interface, which enables users to process it using simple tools. The produced ‘game’ offers a playful, interactive and engaging experience. The application developed encompasses important functionality (kinematics, collision detection, point intersection, movement validation, lightmapping, skinning, animation state machines).

It is then concluded that the implementation of various virtual spaces for teaching allows knowledge development process to be better, where the opportunity is provided to a large number of resources or processes that could be expensive for universities in low-income countries. Similarly, virtual classrooms open the opportunity for more students, especially the ones from the most remote locations to be able to participate in the classes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Higher education institutions, Technologies towards teaching, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

This paper presents the implementation of conceptual maps in laboratory context of an engineering course unit as an active pedagogical approach to foster the students’ meaningful learning in times of COVID pandemic. Different methodologies of laboratory work are first presented, as well as the meaning of conceptual map. Then, an application example on how the conceptual map was introduced in a first laboratory class of Electrical Engineering, and also the students’ experiences and difficulties encountered when dealing with the practical implementation of conceptual maps, is illustrated. Finally, some relevant conclusions about the implementation of this active pedagogical approach are given, in particular the development of the students’ meaningful learning by exploring relationships between concepts, ideas or propositions, by addressing the most important differences and by revealing inconsistencies on the topics studied. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conceptual maps, Remote virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

The toolset brings to students, in a virtual form, one of the most successful domains of formal methods application - railway systems. It consists of a modified version of a railway centralized traffic control simulator called Train Director and a tool that allows signals and switches in a railway scenario, simulated by Train Director, to be controlled by a separate formally developed control program.

Designing a functionally correct system, or a performance constrained system is fundamentally different in the sense that such design requires us to build models and to systematically refine models towards implementation such that correctness is preserved between refinements, and performance optimizations are introduced during refinements. Designing systems with cyber-security properties requires us to not only build models from theoretical principles, but also require modeling possible behaviors of an adversary. Modeling adversarial behavior is akin to test-driven model refinement, and hence not so different from certain approaches used when our goal is functionally correct design. However, for cyber-physical systems, we often need to detect an ongoing cyber attack since safe guards for cyber security often depend on assumptions which can be invalidated (e. g., insider attacks may invalidate perimeter security assumptions). Detecting ongoing attacks requires detecting behavioral anomalies in the physical system under cyber control – thus requiring us to build models from data. Machine learning approaches could be used to build such models. This we view as a schizoid approach – since the designer has to not only model the system from physical principles, he/she also has to build nominal behavioral models from data. While arguing this point of view, we introduce a virtual SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) laboratory we have built to help design cyber security of critical systems. The majority of this talk focuses on describing this software based virtual laboratory called VSCADA.

An international MBDA team has been set up to identify commonalities in any command and control application within the air defence scope. This work led to an open architecture that encapsulates elements that depend on weapon system specificities by the ones that are common. The common elements, covering surveillance, threat evaluation, weapon assignment and engagement control functions within the wide MBDA’s set of effectors, have been developed using MBDA Internal Research Funding and now are used to build up next-generation C2 solutions. The extendible concept behind the framework architecture allows the use of the ‘MBDA Extendible C2’ during the initial phases of the contract (assessment phase, derisking, demonstrator, research) and for the deployment phase by providing the possibility for closed-loop feedback within the customer. The need to work collaboratively across nations leads to the design and delivery of the MBDA Collaborative Environment (or CEM) solution that is a collaborative engineering virtual laboratory for members who are located in separate sites. This environment is protected, which therefore enables the efficient sharing of data between Italy and other entities. This environment is a desktop-virtualization-based technology that creates a cohesive and scalable solution and centralizes the Italian infrastructure. This reduces development time as it allows real-time development and review of design artefacts, reducing the risk of duplication of effort. It reduces development risk of misunderstanding due to parallel development activities. Furthermore, it reduces time and costs of information technology set-up and management, and shipment time and cost.

In order to overcome this problem we present a concept of software based laboratory – VLMS (Virtual Laboratory for Mechatronic Systems).

Most environments deal with such cases by providing an extension facility and letting third parties add required features. The GridSpace environment also includes several mechanisms for extending its own functionality and here we describe how this can be accomplished.

Due to the high computational costs that are necessary to produce virtual environments (VEs), the potential for photorealism is sacrificed. Often these three-dimensional (3D) modeled applications use an unrealistic VE and, therefore, do not provide a full depiction of real-world environments. Panoramas can be used to showcase complex scenarios that are difficult to model and are computationally expensive to view in virtual reality (VR). Utilizing 360° panoramas can provide a low-cost and quick-to-capture alternative with photorealistic representations of the actual environment. The advantages of photorealism over 3D models for training and education are not clearly defined. This paper initially summarizes the development of a VR training application and initial pilot study. Quantitative and qualitative study then was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a 360° panorama VR training application and a 3D modeled one. Switching to a mobile VR headset saves money, increases mobility, decreases set-up and breakdown time, and has less spatial requirements. Testing results of the 3D modeled VE group had an average normalized gain of 0.03 and the 360° panorama group, 0.43. Although the 3D modeled group had slightly higher realism according to the presence questionnaire and had slightly higher averages in the comparative analysis questionnaire, the 360° panorama application has shown to be the most effective for training and the quickest to develop. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Virtual field trip, virtual laboratories, virtual reality, Virtual training",0,1,0,1

Better understanding of the symmetry of molecules requires high visual-spatial thinking ability. Conventional teaching methodologies, with limited teaching aides, fall short in providing a detailed understanding of scientific theories and related concepts. Incorrect understanding has been known to perpetrate concepts that are not consistent with the consensus of the research community or alternate conceptions. This work elaborates a methodology designed to discover the alternate conceptions stemming from teaching molecular symmetry in a typical classroom environment and the impact of the virtual laboratory (VL) environment in correcting these misconceptions. Three significant contributions presented in this paper include: (1) the development of a media and information-intense VL experiment platform designed to enhance understanding of symmetry elements and point groups of molecules with diverse structural geometries. (2) the development of an instrument, Molecular symmetry Alternate Conception Test (MACT), designed to capture and estimate the extent of alternate conceptions. (3) the successful identification of typical alternate conceptions amongst students in the context of molecular symmetry. In addition to perceived alternate concepts in symmetry education, the results indicate a significant statistical improvement of 156% in understanding of molecular symmetry concepts (p < 0.05) after subjecting students to the interactive VL platform. This study also shows identifying bond angles and planarity as concepts crucial for students. It is also implicit that estimations of discrimination skills related to identifying concept-based learning may be relevant for perceiving alternate concepts among learners. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Alternate conception, information and communications technology, Molecular symmetry, Symmetry operations, Virtual lab simulation, web-based learning",0,1,0,1

A web-based virtual laboratory was developed to provide learners with the opportunity to examine the influence of physical factors on gas solubility in water. An evaluation process involving 180 students revealed that the concepts connected to the dissolution of gas in water caused problems for the students even after having experimented with the virtual laboratory. To investigate the nature of learners' reasoning about the visualised events, 13 video-recorded groups of learners were analysed. This study follows the reasoning of one group that displayed a possibly productive way of solving the problem. The results address the students' general difficulty of discovering something that they are conceptually unprepared for within the virtual laboratory. The analysis shows how the students eventually found a way out of their dilemma by making an analogy with other dissolving processes. In effect, the analysis elucidates some of the analytical work that had to be done by the participants when collaboratively negotiating a shared meaning of a scientific concept in concord with a given task and set of instructional materials. Implications for design might be to provide the learning material with explicit hints that enable students to connect to specific phenomena related to the one investigated concept. The findings show the usefulness of video analytic research, informed by CA and ethnomethodology. This analytical framework can support design processes and provide useful information, which might identify hurdles to learning a scientific concept by simulated events and pathways to overcome these hurdles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Collaborative negotiating, Concept of gas solubility in water, Discovery learning, Scientific reasoning, virtual laboratory work",0,1,0,1

Nevertheless, these previous works rest upon the assumption that the knowledge that is learned in virtual laboratories transfers to its equivalent real task. The main contribution of this work is to validate that the knowledge obtained by students in an undergraduate robotics course using computer simulations of 3D model robots can be applied to its real-world context. The experimental platform used to run the computer simulations was based on the Simscape Multibody library of the MATLAB™ software. Results show a satisfactory knowledge transfer because more than 75% of the students finished a forward kinematics problem using a physical manipulator built with LEGO Mindstorms™. In addition, the observation analysis of the professor reveals that students reinforced their knowledge previously learned, and their problem-solving and critical thinking skills also improved. In this way, this study demonstrates that the proposed methodology not only helps the transfer of knowledge to the real-world context but also helps to develop student competencies.

Student feedback showed that the majority of students found the vLab learning experience ""valuable"" and the vLab format/interface ""well-designed"". However, there were a few technical issues with the 1st roll-out of the platform. Conclusions: Our pioneering effort resulted in productive learning with the vLab, with parity with that from a conventional tutorial. Our contingent discussion emphasises not only the cornerstone advantages, but also the shortcomings of the AeLP method utilised. We conclude with an astute analysis of possible extensions and applications of our methodology. © 2016.","Adaptive e-learning, AeLP, Enzyme Kinetics, HTML5, Laboratory skills, Lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, virtual labs, VLab",0,1,0,1

Part II: usage and validation,Computers and Geosciences,2010,Article,"LBflow is a flexible, extensible implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method, developed with geophysical applications in mind. The theoretical basis for LBflow, and its implementation, are presented in the companion paper, 'Part I'. This article covers the practical usage of LBflow and presents guidelines for obtaining optimal results from available computing power. The relationships among simulation resolution, accuracy, runtime and memory requirements are investigated in detail. Particular attention is paid to the origin, quantification and minimization of errors. LBflow is validated against analytical, numerical and experimental results for a range of three-dimensional flow geometries. The fluid conductance of prismatic pipes with various cross sections is calculated with LBflow and found to be in excellent agreement with published results. Simulated flow along sinusoidally constricted pipes gives good agreement with experimental data for a wide range of Reynolds number. The permeability of packs of spheres is determined and shown to be in excellent agreement with analytical results. The accuracy of internal flow patterns within the investigated geometries is also in excellent quantitative agreement with published data. The development of vortices within a sinusoidally constricted pipe with increasing Reynolds number is shown, demonstrating the insight that LBflow can offer as a 'virtual laboratory' for fluid flow. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Part I: theory and implementation,Computers and Geosciences,2010,Article,"This article presents LBflow, a flexible, extensible implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method. The code has been developed with geophysical applications in mind, and is designed to be usable by those with no specialist computational fluid dynamics expertise. LBflow provides a 'virtual laboratory' which can be used, rapidly and easily, to obtain accurate flow data for the geometrically complex, three-dimensional flows that abound in geophysical systems. Parameters can be 'steered' by the user at runtime to allow efficient and intuitive exploration of parameter space. LBflow is written in object-oriented C++ and adopts a modular approach. Lattice Boltzmann algorithms for distinct classes of material are encoded in separate modules, which implement a standard interface, and which are linked to LBflow dynamically at runtime. This allows users with programming skill and expertise in the lattice Boltzmann method to create and share new LBflow modules, extending functionality. A companion application, LBview, provides a graphical user interface to LBflow and renders a user-configurable visualization of the output. LBflow's output can be piped directly to LBview allowing realtime visualization of steered flow. LBview also facilitates analysis of the data generated by LBflow. This article presents an overview of the theory of the lattice Boltzmann method and describes the design and operation of LBflow.

10.1016/j.ces.2011.05.029,Meso-scale oriented simulation towards virtual process engineering (VPE)-The EMMS Paradigm,Chemical Engineering Science,2011,Article,"With the dramatic development of computational science and technology, computer simulation is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research and engineering practice, and is believed to bring about a profound revolution to the mode and means of these activities. For chemical engineering, it will promote the transition from an experience-and-experiment-based research and development mode to the one based on virtual process engineering (VPE). However, such a revolution still requires tremendous improvements in the Accuracy of physical modeling and numerical methods, the Capability of the computing hardware and software, and the Efficiency of the simulation activities, or in short, ACE. This article will systematically review the 3-decade endeavors at IPE, CAS (Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences) on upgrading ACE by establishing a multi-scale computing paradigm focusing on meso-scale structures. We also report recent developments in this direction with projections on future work. Meso-scales refer to the intermediate scales at which the discrete elements in a system interact to shape the global behavior of the system. Reasonable description of the structures at such scales is a bottleneck for reliable and accurate modeling of global behaviors. To address this problem, we started from gas-solid flow by proposing the energy minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model to quantify the hydrodynamics of meso-scale structures in gas-solid fluidization. This model, that is, its stability condition, was thoroughly analyzed and verified with the pseudo-particle modeling (PPM) method. Other systems, such as turbulence and gas-liquid flow, were then studied following the same strategy, revealing the ubiquity of stability conditions for meso-scale structures as a result of the compromise among different dominant mechanisms, and leading to a generalized model mathematically formulated as a multi-objective variational (MOV) problem. Meanwhile, along with wider industrial applications of the EMMS-based simulation methods, common features were recognized that ACE requires structural consistency among the simulated system, the physical model, the numerical software and the computing hardware under the umbrella of MOV, which we have named as the EMMS Paradigm. The EMMS Paradigm was first implemented from the software level using traditional computing hardware to achieve Accuracy. Since 2007, with the development of general-purpose GPU (graphic processing unit) computing, CPU (central processing unit)-GPU hybrid computing was deployed to implement the Paradigm from the hardware level, boosting the Capability to Petaflops range. In applying the Paradigm to the development of an industrial petro-chemical process (maximizing iso-paraffins, MIP), enabling technologies such as pre- and post-processing, error-tolerance, network-based computing and seamless integration of different simulation methods are now under development, which will greatly improve the Efficiency. A demonstration virtual laboratory featuring the comparison and interaction of online measurement and real-time computing is under construction. With these endeavors, an industrial process could be simulated globally in almost real-time, and different levels of details could be traced from the global distribution of flow parameters in a reactor to the inner-channels of catalytic particles at a perceivable evolution speed. The realization of VPE is, therefore, in the foreseeable future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex system, GPU computing, Meso-scale, Multi-phase flow, Multi-scale, Virtual process engineering",0,1,0,1

This comes out from the fact that education in technical disciplines inevitably involves laboratory exercises and this fact drastically increases the complexity of a potential e-learning system. New approach and new specific knowledge are needed to develop such a system. We expect to meet the requirements of distance learning by developing the software-based laboratory exercises, i.e., a virtual laboratory. To fully substitute a physical system like laboratory equipment, one must emulate its full dynamics. The mathematical model in the form of differential equations will be applied to calculate dynamics and provide the data that would otherwise be measured on a physical system - this means simulation. To prove the feasibility of the concept and make a step towards full e-learning in technical disciplines, we consider a complex technical field, Mechatronics and more precisely, Robotics being a perfect symbiosis of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.

Virtual laboratories, by overcoming some limitations of conventional hands-on experiments, have been adopted as a complement or in substitution of laboratory sessions. This paper describes the design and implementation of two virtual labs for biochemical engineering education intended for students at the BSc degree. One of the virtual labs is intended to fully replace the hands-on experiment and consists on the determination of the correlation between oxygen transfer rate, aeration rate and agitation power in a reactor. The other virtual lab consists on the determination of the residence time distribution (RTD) in continuous stirred tanks series and was implemented to support the physical experiments rather than replacing them. The virtual labs provide the students a learning platform covering the fundamentals underlying the experiment, its pre-visualization and simulation. The effectiveness of the implemented system was evaluated through direct experimentation and survey (through questionnaires) with students taking the chemical technology lab course. For the RTD virtual Lab, and based on specific learning outcomes, teachers could assess significant improvement in students' performance in the lab and also a more thorough discussion of the results in the reports.

These academic tools must be user-friendly for teachers and students and easy to adapt to practical cases. The Chemical and Environmental Engineering Group (GIQA) at University Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) has developed a Kinetic, Modeling and Simulation (KMS) platform for chemical and biochemical processes. The KMS platform provides different simulation applications programmed in Matlab® with a friendly interface design environment for users. In this work, we will focus on the Kinetics in Conventional Activated Sludge (KCAS) application, as part of the KMS platform. The design of kinetic models and the dynamic simulation of wastewater treatment plants are typically implemented by a variety of dedicated software, mostly developed for research and development purposes at universities, institutes or consulting companies. These programming tools have inherent weaknesses as simulators in virtual laboratories for academics, needing steep learning curves and lacking flexibility to evaluate complex problems, particularly in bachelor degrees programs that are not completely devoted to the mathematical modeling of processes. The simplicity and versatility of KCAS simulator make it very useful for students as starting educational tool to define kinetic models and to make the dynamic simulation of a conventional activated sludge reactor followed by a secondary decanter using different inlet streams or operation conditions. The students interact with the program through a friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), and the results can be easily exported to a conventional spreadsheet in EXCEL© format files. With KCAS, the students can formulate kinetic models (potential models, diffusional models, Monod equations, etc.) to simulate the evolution from simple reaction systems, to complex biochemical models such as ASM (Activated Sludge Models) from the International Water Association (IWA). The KCAS simulator allows the students to enhance the understanding of complex interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological processes, reinforcing the acquisition of competences and learning skills in Environmental Engineering.

The PID controller theory should be supported by some practices that help students to bring the ""real world"" into an otherwise theoretical education. This paper presents a PID Control WebLab that has been developed with a set of related learning resources using an innovative methodology. Traditional laboratories lessons have been adapted to an e-learning strategy based on a virtual laboratory embedded into a Shared Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) package along with a set of related learning resources. The result is a SCORM package including a learning path with specific theory, tests and a series of experiments where the assessment of the work performed by each student is recorded in the Learning Management System (LMS). The package itself constitutes a learning resource that can be reused in any SCORM supported LMS. This PID Control WebLab has been offered to 340 students of the ""Industrial Automation"" subject of the University of Jaén in the 2014-15 course. Several evaluations of this WebLab, also included in this paper, demonstrate that this proposal has produced excellent results in the knowledge obtained by the students, the WebLab has helped students to pass the subject final exam and it has been highly regarded by its users: the learners. © 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Given their heterogeneous nature, CPS are naturally designed in the so-called simulation-centric process, where physical equipment design are translated into behavioral simulation models. Although many tools exist to ease the design phase in the different disciplines, their full integration is still an open problem. This fact holds particularly true in a control-design perspective, given that in a CPS the “plant” has a heterogeneous nature, and the design of model-based, advanced control techniques would strongly benefit from the availability of a common modelling environment. In this paper, we try to enhance this simulation-centric process by introducing a pure simulation kind of prototype, based on the co-simulation of the firmware and of the multi-physical controlled system. We introduce some innovative tools, implemented in µLab/CfL, and discuss upon their impact towards a better collaborative design and integration during the design of CPS.

The main difference with the usual Earth-based laboratories is that we cannot control the experiments. Instead, we have no choice but to create virtual laboratories on Earth, in order to simulate all the relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments. This implies a realistic treatment of stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics. Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses that are routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and stellar collisions, respectively. I outline the main steps that need to be taken in order to embed and where needed transform these legacy codes in order to produce a far more modular and robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems. The time is right to do so: within a few years computers will reach the required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a star cluster with a million stars for 10 billion years, while resolving the internal binary and multiple star motions.

Individual molecular properties are injected into thermal and mechanical models, and macroscopic gas behaviors can be detected and quantified by 3D virtual instruments, created in order to involve the user into the simulation. In order to assess its ability to simulate thermodynamic experiments, our method is applied to classical situations, such as the Joule-Gay Lussac experiment or the maxwellian relaxation in a hard-sphere gas. The simulated gas behavior is in good agreement with theoretical results for gases without interaction. Taking into account the volume of the molecules, our method also allows to quantify the mean free path and the average collision time for Neon and Xenon hard-sphere gases at equilibrium.

Within a constructivists learning model with a multi perspective approach it is necessary for students to have an environment where they can perform scientific and technological experiments. Working in a science lab creates an interactive experience that encourages development and provides practical knowledge. Some cognitive processes arise through interaction; these play an important role in semantic construction. Usability within a platform refers to the interaction between the software and the users. This means the software will be easy to learn and navigate, allowing the user explore its potential through an attractive interface and operations. The software can be use efficiently, minimizing errors and increase user satisfaction, among others. This article focuses on studying the design and construction of a virtual laboratory through human interaction, to solve a problem through a virtual science lab. The student reads from his book Practice of Science, which outlines a task to perform. During the activity time, the student can interact with laboratory instruments. Even when following instructions, the student may overlook some details, which could lead to accidents or laboratory instruments damage. The result of the research includes an analysis of the construction of a virtual lab and the experience of users throughout their educational experience. © 2015 The Authors.","augmented reality, Constructivist learning, usability",0,1,0,1

The Australian Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory (IELab) is a novel, collaborative approach to compiling large-scale environmentally extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) models.The utility of the IELab product is greatly enhanced by avoiding the need to lock in an MRIO structure at the time the MRIO system is developed. The IELab advances the idea of the ""mother-daughter"" construction principle, whereby a regionally and sectorally very detailed ""mother"" table is set up, from which ""daughter"" tables are derived to suit specific research questions. By introducing a third tier - the ""root classification"" - IELab users are able to define their own mother-MRIO configuration, at no additional cost in terms of data handling. Customised mother-MRIOs can then be built, which maximise disaggregation in aspects that are useful to a family of research questions.The second innovation in the IELab system is to provide a highly automated collaborative research platform in a cloud-computing environment, greatly expediting workflows and making these computational benefits accessible to all users.Combining these two aspects realises many benefits. The collaborative nature of the IELab development project allows significant savings in resources. Timely deployment is possible by coupling automation procedures with the comprehensive input from multiple teams. User-defined MRIO tables, coupled with high performance computing, mean that MRIO analysis will be useful and accessible for a great many more research applications than would otherwise be possible. By ensuring that a common set of analytical tools such as for hybrid life-cycle assessment is adopted, the IELab will facilitate the harmonisation of fragmented, dispersed and misaligned raw data for the benefit of all interested parties. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Australia, collaboration, Electronic research infrastructure, Life cycle assessment, multi-region input-output tables, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

Subsequently, schools, colleges, and universities were closed on March 26, which forced a massive migration to virtual education and impacted laboratory-based teaching courses. The teaching of biochemistry requires an experimental component that virtual laboratories cannot emulate. To address this concern, the article describes an at-home biochemistry laboratory experience that explores the hydrolysis of starch by α-amylase as a function of enzyme concentration, reaction time, and pH. The general success of the experience was assessed through the quality of information submitted through laboratory reports and feedback from students. A total of 19 laboratory reports were reviewed, and 50 students were surveyed. The analysis indicated that approximately 90% of students expressed favorable opinions about the experience. They understood the objective of the practice, identified the function of each material, and explained the relationship between the obtained results and concepts of enzyme activity presented in theoretical classes. Finally, the study concluded that the at-home laboratory experience is inexpensive and easy to perform outside the traditional laboratory.

Biol.,2020,Article,"Experiments with synthetic genetic logic circuits can be time-consuming and expensive. Accordingly, advances in the field of computer-aided design and simulation of genetic circuits have reduced the cost and time required for experimentation. D-VASim is the first genetic circuit simulation tool that allows users to interact with the model during run-time. In contrast to electronic circuits, genetic circuits have different threshold values for different circuits, which need to be estimated prior to simulation. D-VASim allows the user to perform threshold concentration and propagation delay analysis before simulating the circuit. The algorithm currently used in D-VASim has considerable scope for improvements. Thus, we propose a parallel implementation of the algorithm, significantly faster by up to 16 times. In adddition, we improve the algorithm for consistent runtimes across multiple simulation runs under the same parameter settings, reducing the worst-case standard deviation in runtime from 6.637 to 1.841. Our algorithm also estimates the threshold value more accurately, as evident from experimentation for long runtimes. With these modifications, the utility of D-VASim as a virtual laboratory environment has been significantly enhanced. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","genetic logic circuits, parallel programming LATEX, SBML, stochastic simulation, synthetic biology, threshold value analysis, timing analysis, virtual instrumentation",0,1,0,1

The proposed approach deals with enhancing self-learning of one of the most common tests used in materials engineering and/or civil engineering, namely, the compression test of concrete samples. To achieve this goal, two didactic-propose computational tools were developed: a virtual laboratory (VL) and video tutorials (VTs). Furthermore, two different teaching/learning experiences are compared in this paper: (1) using actual laboratory after using both virtual environments (VL and VTs); and (2) using only virtual environments. In both cases the use of these virtual tools improves the student learning outcomes, especially when these resources fulfill a lack of real equipment.

Simtronics simulator is a powerful tool to teach process industry skills and it is recognized in both industry and educational institutions. It also provides a virtual environment, which is clear and engaging, with navigational signs to guide a user through a process operation consisting of several unit operations. Hence, SPM 700 Distillation Column was utilized to conduct the continuous distillation experiment and acquire the experimental results virtually. The results were further validated by employing the McCabe–Thiele graphical method, which is considered the most instructive method for the analysis of binary distillation.

From an Information, Communication and Technology perspective, data interoperability and standardization are critical to improve data access and exchange as promoted by the Group on Earth Observations. GEOEssential is following an end-user driven approach by defining Essential Variables (EVs), as an intermediate value between environmental policy indicators and their appropriate data sources. From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows. To interpret and present the relevant outputs/results carried out by the different thematic workflows considered in GEOEssential (i.e. biodiversity, ecosystems, extractives, night light, and food-water-energy nexus), a Dashboard is built as a visual front-end.

This allows us to study the spatial-temporal propagation of ultrafast pulses as well as the influence of high-order spectral phases such as group delay dispersion and third-order dispersion on pulse compression in time. The NLS can describe several nonlinear effects, in particular in this paper we consider the Kerr effect, cross-polarized wave generation and cubic-quintic propagation in order to highlight the potential of this equation combined with the GUIDE environment. Graphical user interfaces are commonly used in science and engineering teaching due to their educational value, and have proven to be an effective way to engage and motivate students.

Some students in this group may feel some degree of aversion towards these types of pure science-related subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc). In online learning scenarios, the average student is already an adult (37 years old or above) and may see no particular application of the aforementioned courses in their current or future professional life. Besides this, online institutions tend to lean too much on applet-based simulations. Although they may shed some light on the theory associated with the studied physical processes, these animated and interactive examples also seem to be ' stripped down' versions of the real events, and are felt to be disconnected from current scientific environments and engineering settings. For this reason, we describe a novel virtual lab approach to teach the basics of the low-energy interactions present in average x-ray settings. It combines real scientific simulation frameworks with modern computing techniques such as virtualization, cloud infrastructures, containers, networking and shared collaboration environments. It also fosters the use of hugely demanded development tools and programming languages and addresses the fundamentals of digital radiography and the linked electronic standards for image storage and transmission. With this mixed approach, blending scientific concepts, healthcare and state-of-the-art software solutions, our virtual labs have proven (over a period of five academic terms) to be both very attractive to and pedagogically successful (technically, and scientifically) for online engineering undergraduates.

Many software tools have been developed to perform in silico analysis for this purpose, but none of them allow users to interact with the model during runtime. The runtime interaction gives the user a feeling of being in the lab performing a real world experiment. In this work, we present a user-friendly software tool named D-VASim (Dynamic Virtual Analyzer and Simulator), which provides a virtual laboratory environment to simulate and analyze the behavior of genetic logic circuit models represented in an SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). Hence, SBML models developed in other software environments can be analyzed and simulated in D-VASim. D-VASim offers deterministic as well as stochastic simulation; and differs from other software tools by being able to extract and validate the Boolean logic from the SBML model. D-VASim is also capable of analyzing the threshold value and propagation delay of a genetic circuit model. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

10.1093/llc/fqt064,A data-centred 'virtual laboratory' for the humanities: Designing the australian humanities networked infrastructure (HuNI) service,Literary and Linguistic Computing,2013,Article,"This article looks at the design and architecture proposed for the Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI), a national 'virtual laboratory', which is being developed as part of the Australian government's National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) programme. The article focuses on explaining the overall approach proposed for building the HuNI environment; it is not a detailed account of the technical aspects of HuNI's architecture, nor a report on the progress of the project. Instead, it discusses how HuNI is expected to differ from other approaches used to design digital resources and tools for the humanities, and how the complex research methods used by humanities researchers will be reflected in HuNI's design. HuNI intends to take a new approach to data aggregation and data-centred workflows for humanities research. This approach relies on an understanding of 'humanities data' as the various annotations, tags, links, associations, ratings, reviews, and comments produced during the humanities research process, together with the semantic 'entities' to which these annotations refer: concepts, persons, places, and events. A range of different data sets from various Australian providers are being ingested and transformed into Linked Data formats, and subsequently matched and aligned to a common ontology framework. A suite of virtual laboratory tools will also be deployed, enabling researchers to manipulate the aggregated data and to share their work. © The Author 2013.

Radiological studies and emergency laboratory test are of high importance for the management of hospital patients. However, it is known that during these events, they can generate significant bottlenecks. Appropriate request of such tests is of utmost importance to not generate delays in the patient flow. The aim of this paper is to describe a software designed to increase the realism of hospital-based MCI training through a realistic reproduction of radiology and laboratory departments. Methods In this paper, we present a Virtual Laboratory and Imaging system that we designed with the goal of increasing the realism of full-scale mass casualty simulations. The system is able to dynamically manage the speed and load of virtual departments while collecting data on usage and load, and provide data useful for the after-event debriefing. We tested this system in two pilot simulations involving, respectively, 105 and 89 simulated casualties. Results The system, by measuring the number of requests and exams' turnaround time, enabled an objective measurement of the laboratory and radiology workload during simulated MCIs. It was possible to identify bottlenecks and consequently use these data for after-action debriefing. Conclusion The tool not only increased the simulation realism by adding the radiology and laboratory departments but also provided valuable data that could be used for educational and organizational purposes. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This paper describes how we implemented a service-based infrastructure into the CARMEN Virtual Laboratory. A Software as a Service framework was developed to allow generic new and legacy code to be deployed as services on a heterogeneous execution framework. Users can submit analysis code typically written in Matlab, Python, C/C++ and R as non-interactive standalone command-line applications and wrap them as services in a form suitable for deployment on the platform. The CARMEN Service Builder tool enables neuroscientists to quickly wrap their analysis software for deployment to the CARMEN platform, as a service without knowledge of the service framework or the CARMEN system. A metadata schema describes each service in terms of both system and user requirements. The search functionality allows services to be quickly discovered from the many services available. Within the platform, services may be combined into more complicated analyses using the workflow tool. CARMEN and the service infrastructure are targeted towards the neuroscience community; however, it is a generic platform, and can be targeted towards any discipline. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

10.1108/10650741211253877,WebLab of a DC motor speed control didactical experiment,Campus-Wide Information Systems,2012,Article,"Purpose: Weblabs are an additional resource in the execution of experiments in control engineering education, making learning process more flexible both in time, by allowing extra class laboratory activities, and space, bringing the learning experience to remote locations where experimentation facilities would not be available. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and report on a weblab project where the speed of a DC motor is controlled in closed loop, being the control system parameters set by the remote user (student). Design/methodology/approach: The engine control experiments are run and on-line transmitted by videoconference over the internet, from a didactical plant physically located at the Systems and Automation Laboratory of the Control and Automation Engineering department of the Pontifical Catholic University of Parana. The system response (transient motor speed) to the user's choice of parameters is evaluated through performance indices (IAE, ITAE), which are used to qualify the ability of the student to tune PID and RTS control algorithms. There is an option to run experiments in open loop, so the student can perform preliminary analysis to identify the system dynamic model and then apply mathematical models and computational methods, learned in theoretical classes, to define best performance control parameters. A simulation function was implemented, to further help the student in the problem solution. Virtual instrumentation resources were used to implement the Weblab, using the DC motor of a laboratory didactical plant. A local server runs a LabVIEWTM application, which can be remotely accessed in the client side through a web browser, where the system front panel is reproduced. This remote interface is directly originated at the LabVIEWTM application, through an embedded web server. At the user request, the control of the remote system is granted. The user interface is cognitive, with motor speed, control signal, set point and all the pertinent information displayed in evolving charts and indicators. Microsoft™ Skype is used to establish a videoconference with the laboratory where the plant is located. Results of the user experiments are stored in local files, which can be e-mailed to the user at his command by the end of the session. Findings: Used as a platform in weblab projects, LabVIEW combined with Skype provides a suitable solution for the necessary software/hardware integration for communications with data acquisition systems and advanced connectivity resources. In virtual instrumentation Skype has proved to be efficient in establishing the right environment without the need for developing complex software for teaching practical control engineering concepts. Research limitations/implications: The level of performance (speed of acquisition, accuracy and number of parameters that could be evaluated) of the current system would need to be evaluated compared to some existing systems. The implication is the changes brought to the adopted approach to the development of, access to and the overall cost of producing virtual laboratory systems used for science, engineering and technology education. Practical implications: With further effort, the current and similar systems could be further upgraded with user login control and server, so that results can be submitted to the tutor, thus acting as a learning evaluation instrument. Originality/value: The originality of this research lies in the innovative integration of technology in education, which involves the implementation of a carefully designed, cost-effective virtual laboratory for teaching and learning of concepts in control engineering. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brazil, control engineering, distance learning, Internet, LabVIEW, Networking technologies, Skype, Universities, virtual laboratory, virtual learning environment, Weblab",0,1,0,1

Design/methodology/approach: The implementation of distance learning and e-learning in engineering sciences (such as Mechanical and Electrical Engineering) is still far behind current practice in narrative disciplines (Economics, Management, etc.). This is because education in technical disciplines requires laboratory exercises, providing skill-acquisition and hands-on experience. In order to overcome this problem for distance-learning developers and practitioners, a new modular and hierarchically organized approach is needed. Findings: The concept involves simulation models to emulate system dynamics, full virtual reality to provide visualization, advanced social-clubbing to ensure proper communication, and an AI tutor to supervise the lab work. Its modularity and hierarchical organization offer the possibility of applying the concept to practically any engineering field: a higher level provides the general framework - it considers lab workplaces as objects regardless of the technical field they come from, and provides communication and supervision - while the lower level deals with particular workplaces. An improved student's motivation is expected. Originality/value: The proposed concept aims rather high, thus making the work truly challenging. With the current level of information and communication technologies, some of the required features can only be achieved with difficulty; however, the rapid growth of the relevant technologies supports the eventual practicality of the concept. This paper is not intended to present any final results, solutions, or experience.

This is a common problem in MOOCs: experimentation is neglected because of the lack of effective methods or tools using this new platform. The drawbacks of offline experiments, such as the lack of interaction among teacher and students and insufficient supervision [6], [7], also prevent their wide employment in MOOCs. As a result, the lack of experimental teaching in MOOCs causes great trouble to both teachers and students, weakens the effectiveness of courses, and prohibits teaching some experimental courses via MOOCs. Fortunately, with the rapid development of science and technology, the rise of cloud technology provides a new choice for laboratory construction. Virtualization technology based on cloud computing can radically solve existing problems, such as an excessive number of students or lack of experimental resources. In addition, the large-scale data-processing ability in the cloud computing environment also makes it possible for teachers and students to interact on the MOOC platform. © 1991-2012 IEEE.","Digital control, cloud computing, computer-aided instruction, Solid modeling, Electronic learning, computational modeling, Real-time systems",0,1,0,1

Global physical input–output tables (gPIOTs) collate a vast array of information on the world economy's physical structure and its interdependence with the environment, which can help to monitor progress toward a sustainable circular economy. However, building gPIOTs requires dealing with mismatched and incomplete primary data with high uncertainties, which makes it a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor. We address this challenge by introducing the PIOLab: A virtual laboratory for building gPIOTs. This represents the newest branch of the industrial ecology virtual laboratory (IELab) concept, a cloud-computing platform and collaborative research environment through which participants can pool resources to assemble individual input–output tables that target specific research questions. To overcome the lack of primary data, the PIOLab builds extensively upon secondary data derived from a variety of models commonly used in industrial ecology. We use the case of global iron-steel supply chains to describe the architecture of the PIOLab and highlight its analytical capabilities. A major strength of the gPIOT is its ability to provide mass-balanced indicators on both apparent/direct and embodied/indirect flows, for regions and disaggregated economic sectors. We present the first gPIOTs for 10 years (2008–2017), covering 32 regions, 30 processes, and 39 types of iron/steel flows. Diagnostic tests of the data reconciliation show a good level of adherence between raw data and the values realized in the gPIOT. We conclude with elaborating on how the PIOLab will be extended to cover other materials and energy flows.

10.1111/tgis.12012,Using pattern-oriented modeling (pom) to cope with uncertainty in multi-scale agent-based models of land change,Transactions in GIS,2013,Article,"Local land-use and -cover changes (LUCCs) are the result of both the decisions and actions of individual land-users, and the larger global and regional economic, political, cultural, and environmental contexts in which land-use systems are embedded. However, the dearth of detailed empirical data and knowledge of the influences of global/regional forces on local land-use decisions is a substantial challenge to formulating multi-scale agent-based models (ABMs) of land change. Pattern-oriented modeling (POM) is a means to cope with such process and parameter uncertainty, and to design process-based land change models despite a lack of detailed process knowledge or empirical data. POM was applied to a simplified agent-based model of LUCC to design and test model relationships linking global market influence to agents' land-use decisions within an example test site. Results demonstrated that evaluating alternative model parameterizations based on their ability to simultaneously reproduce target patterns led to more realistic land-use outcomes. This framework is promising as an agent-based virtual laboratory to test hypotheses of how and under what conditions driving forces of land change differ from a generalized model representation depending on the particular land-use system and location. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","General Earth and Planetary Sciences, Scale (chemistry), Operations research, Pattern-oriented modeling, Land change, Test site, Process (engineering), Design process, Management science, Process knowledge, Geography, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The laboratory facility consists of a high-speed fan that delivers a maximum of 2.5 kg/s of air to the cascade. Traversing pneumatic probes are used to determine pressure profiles at upstream and downstream locations, and loss coefficients are later computed. Newly added equipment includes cameras, stepper motors, and a data acquisition and control system for remote operation.

10.1115/GT2014-25943,Upgrading the undergraduate gas turbine lab,Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition,2014,Conference Paper,"A study of gas turbine engines is an important component of an integrated thermodynamics and fluid mechanics two-course sequence at the United States Military Academy (USMA). Owing to the ubiquity of gas turbines in military use, graduating cadets will encounter a variety of these engines throughout their military careers. Especially for this unique population, it is important for engineering students to be familiar with the operation and applications of gas turbines. Experimental analysis of a functional auxiliary power unit (APU) from an Army utility helicopter has been a key component of this block of instruction for several decades. As with all laboratory equipment, the APU has experienced intermittent maintenance issues, which occasionally render it unusable for the gas turbine laboratory in the course. Because of this, a very basic virtual laboratory was implemented which integrated video of the physical laboratory with key parameters and behind-the-screen data collection for use in engine analysis. A revitalized version of both the physical and virtual gas turbine laboratory experiences offered in the thermal-fluids course will include substantial improvements over the existing setup. The physical laboratory, which is centered on a refurbished APU from a medium-sized commercial aircraft, will continue to incorporate measurements of temperature and pressure throughout the combustion process, as well as fuel flow rate. In an improvement over the original laboratory setup, an orifice plate will be used to measure the flow rate of bleed air exiting the turbine, which had not previously been open during engine testing. Additionally, the air flow through the anti-surge valve was not metered in the original version of the physical laboratory. However, the anti-surge air flow can account for nearly 25% of the total air flow, and performance calculations in the physical laboratory will now account for this loss. The turbine output shaft will run a water-brake dynamometer. All instrumentation will be converted to digital signals and projected on a large screen outside the test area through a LabVIEW front panel. The virtual laboratory will include the same metering options as the operational APU. In addition, the virtual laboratory will include the option to alter engine operating parameters, such as inlet temperature and pressure or exhaust temperatures, and students may conduct broad parameter sweeps across ranges of possible inputs or desired outputs. These improvements will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of gas turbine operation and capabilities in practical applications. The improved laboratory will be implemented in Spring, 2014.

10.1115/imece2011-63743,Overcoming the limitations of current online laboratory systems using game-based virtual environments,International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,2011,Conference Paper,"Current online laboratory systems based on either remotely operated hardware or pure software simulations are often criticized for lacking experimental setup experience and for being limited to the data collection and result analysis aspects of traditional hands-on laboratories. One possible solution for overcoming these shortcomings is to use a multi-player computer game engine for implementing interactive laboratory environments. Taking advantage of game technology, the students are enabled to simultaneously interact with laboratory equipment in the virtual laboratory and to communicate with each other through voice or chat. In particular, assembling the experimental equipment before using it in some experimental procedure can become part of the laboratory exercise. In this article, a virtual gear design laboratory environment for a junior-level undergraduate mechanical engineering course on mechanisms and machine dynamics is presented. This virtual laboratory environment implemented using a multiplayer computer game engine provides the students with the flexibility to perform various experiments related to the concepts of the fundamental law of gearing and to planetary motion of gears. In this environment, the students can work in teams to interactively select and cooperatively assemble gear train components piece by piece into a more complex experimental apparatus. This article describes the assembly logic that is used to combine individual components into experimental setups as part of the experimental procedure in student laboratories. Furthermore, the game environment can be equipped with functionality for monitoring the students' progress and learning outcomes, thus enabling skill-based assessment.

However, combining the advantages of both these approaches and integrating them into an effective learning environment has not been reported yet. One of the challenges in creating such a combination is to overcome the barriers between real and virtual systems, i.e. to select compatible platforms, to achieve an efficient mapping between the real world and the virtual environment and to arrange for efficient communications between the different system components. This paper will present a pilot implementation of a multi-player game-based virtual laboratory environment that is linked to the remote experimental setup of an air flow rig. This system is designed for a junior-level mechanical engineering laboratory on fluid mechanics. In order to integrate this remote laboratory setup into the virtual laboratory environment, an existing remote laboratory architecture had to be redesigned. The integrated virtual laboratory platform consists of two main parts, namely an actual physical experimental device controlled by a remote controller and a virtual laboratory environment that was implemented using the 'Source' game engine, which forms the basis of the commercially available computer game 'Half- Life 2' in conjunction with 'Garry's Mod' (GM). The system implemented involves a local device controller that exchanges data in the form of shared variables and Dynamical Link Library (DLL) files with the virtual laboratory environment, thus establishing the control of real physical experiments from inside the virtual laboratory environment. The application of a combination of C++ code, Lua scripts [ 1 ] and LabVIEW Virtual Instruments makes the platform very flexible and expandable. This paper will present the architecture of this platform and discuss the general benefits of virtual environments that are linked with real physical devices.

10.1115/IMECE2014-37149,An efficient method for creating virtual spaces for virtual reality,International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition,2014,Conference Paper,"A virtual space (VS) is an indispensable component of a virtual environment (VE) in virtual reality (VR). Usually, it is created using general tools and skills that are independent of the users' specific applications and intents. Creating a VS by surveying the real world with traditional measuring tools or creating virtual features with CAD software involves many steps and thus is time consuming and complicated. This renders the construction of VEs difficult, impairs their flexibility and hampers their widespread usage. In this paper, an efficient method for creating VSs with a handheld camera is introduced. In this approach, the camera is used as a measuring tool that scans the real scene and obtains the corresponding surface information. This information is then used to generate a virtual 3D model through a series of data processing procedures. Firstly, the camera's pose is traced in order to locate the points of the scene's surface, whereby these surface points form a point cloud. Then, this point cloud is meshed and the mesh elements are textured automatically one by one. Unfortunately, the virtual 3D model resulting from this procedure represents an impenetrable solid and thus collision detection would prevent the avatars from entering into this VS. Therefore, an approach for eliminating this restriction is proposed here. Finally, a game-based virtual laboratory (GBVL) for an undergraduate mechanical engineering class was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology. The model format used in Garry's Mod (GMod) is also found in other VEs, and therefore the method proposed here can be straightforwardly generalized to other VE implementations.

In order to simulate assembly processes by computers for educational purposes, all these factors should be considered. Virtual reality (VR) technology, which aims to integrate natural human motion into real-world scenarios, provides an ideal simulation medium. Novel VR devices such as 3D glasses, motion-tracking gloves, haptic sensors, etc. are able to fulfill fundamental assembly simulation needs. However, most of these implementations focus on assembly simulations for computer-aided design, which are geared toward professionals rather than students, thus leading to complicated assembly procedures not suitable for students. Furthermore, the costs of these novel VR devices and specifically designed VR platforms represent an untenable financial burden for most educational institutions. In this paper, a virtual platform for mechanical assembly education based on the Microsoft Kinect sensor and Garry's Mod (GMod) is presented. With the help of the Kinect's body tracking function and voice recognition technology in conjunction with the graphics and physics simulation capabilities of GMod, a low-cost VR platform that enables educators to author their own assembly simulations was implemented. This platform utilizes the Kinect as the sole input device. Students can use voice commands to navigate their avatars inside of a GMod powered virtual laboratory as well as use their body's motions to integrate pre-defined mechanical parts into assemblies. Under this platform, assembly procedures involving the picking, placing and attaching of parts can be performed collaboratively by multiple users. In addition, the platform allows collaborative learning without the need for the learners to be co-located. A pilot study for this platform showed that, with the instructor's assistance, mechanical engineering undergraduate students are able to complete basic assembly operations.

An efficient technology of deferred synthesis of stereo clips is proposed. It allows one to create stereo clips without interfering with real-time visualization. The technology includes real-time construction of visualization scenario and offline transformation of the scenario into a stereo clip. Methods for implementing these stages for the task of stereo visualization of the saturation isosurface of displacing fluid are considered. For this purpose, a special file format «scr» for the visualization scenario is developed on the basis of chunk data structures. This format provides a compact representation of neighboring repeated frames. The scenario file is transformed into a sequence of 4K stereo pairs by means of the offscreen rendering technology of the virtual scene, and stereo pairs are added to the stereo clip using a number of open-source FFmpeg libraries designed for processing digital video content. The generated stereo clip is placed within an MP4 container, and the video compressing standard H.264 is used. The proposed technologies and methods of 4K stereo clip deferred synthesis are implemented in a software designed for visualizing simulation results of the unstable displacement of oil from porous media. Using this software, a 4K stereo clip is created, which illustrates the evolution of the saturation isosurface during the process of unstable oil displacement. Testing confirmed the validity of the solution.

This virtual laboratory method is then compared with two other commonly used synchronous usability test methods: the traditional lab approach and WebEx, a web-based conferencing and screen sharing approach. A study was conducted with 48 participants in total, 36 test participants and 12 test facilitators. The test participants completed 5 tasks on a simulated e-commerce website. The three methodologies were compared with respect to the following dependent variables: the time taken to complete the tasks; the usability defects identified; the severity of these usability defects; and the subjective ratings from NASA-TLX, presence and post-test subjective questionnaires. The three methodologies agreed closely in terms of the total number defects identified, number of high severity defects identified and the time taken to complete the tasks. However, there was a significant difference in the workload experienced by the test participants and facilitators, with the traditional lab condition imposing the least and the virtual lab and the WebEx conditions imposing similar levels. It was also found that the test participants experienced greater involvement and a more immersive experience in the virtual world condition than the WebEx condition. These ratings were not significantly different from those in the traditional lab condition. The results of this study suggest that participants were productive and enjoyed the virtual lab condition, indicating the potential of a virtual world based approach as an alternative to the conventional approaches for synchronous usability testing.

Existing laboratory solutions are usually expensive to build, configure and maintain, while still lacking reusability, flexibility and scalability. This paper presents a cloud-based virtual laboratory education solution, called V-Lab, where instructors can use an interactive web GUI to configure computer network testbeds based on a set of dedicated virtual computers interconnected through VLAN-based virtual networks. The established virtual network system can be accessed by students via remote access using standard Secure Shell (SSH), Virtual Network Computing (VNC), or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). By using a flexible and re-configurable design, V-Lab greatly reduces the effort needed to establish and maintain a physical laboratory, while providing a secure and reliable environment that encourages students to use the resources based on their own schedule. V-Lab also helps re-design laboratory curriculum to focus on six educational factors, and the survey results show that V-Lab system is easy to use and setup and has satisfactory performance and reliability.

We used the Science Gateway Canvas for a systematic analysis and comparison of the functions offered by a selection of available frameworks that are used to build SGs. This illustrated the applicability of the Science Gateway Canvas as a comprehensive and generic reference model for understanding SGs.

To address this challenge, IoT middleware platforms have been proposed to abstract away the specificities of such devices, promoting interoperability among them, and easing application development. One of these proposals is FIWARE, an open, generic platform developed in the European Community to leverage the development of Future Internet applications. Given a set of FIWARE components required for a specific application under development, their deployment and configuration can be made either manually or using a container-based approach. However, setting up an environment composed by the main FIWARE components might sometimes not be a trivial process. This paper introduces FIWARE-Lab@RNP, a Web virtual laboratory for prototyping and experimenting applications based on the FIWARE platform. The main concern of FIWARE-Lab@RNP is enabling the use of FIWARE resources through the Internet in a transparent way, thus relieving users from the need of deploying and operating a FIWARE instance on their development or owned environment. The virtual laboratory provides functionalities for easily creating, configuring, and managing instances of FIWARE components, devices, context entities, and services while attempting to minimize the learning curve regarding these tasks. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

The reasons to implement it were: (1) to use different configurations of industrial robots, (2) to decrease the use of a real laboratory with expensive equipment, (3) to avoid accidents and misuse of equipment, (4) to use a robot for each student, and (5) to know the perception of engineering students, about using a VL in their course. The novelty of this work is that VL is based on the use of a mechanism simulation module of a CAD program (Computer-aided design). On the other hand, its implementation can be replicated with any other program of this type. Other industrial robot simulators are based on a single type of robot, which is sometimes experimental or didactic. In this case, the simulator presented uses three industrial robots of the ABB company. Because the VL is based on a CAD program application, its cost is less than a sophisticated program aimed at programming industrial robots; professors can also vary the level or depth of the knowledge they want to teach. It can be used for an introductory course or an advanced robotics course according to the equations that are programmed. Another advantage is that the simulator allows a new type of robot to be incorporated to have a greater variety of configurations without the need to write some type of computer code. By using a CAD program, users can print the robot models in 3D or apply engineering analysis to determine mechanical stresses in their components, which allows endless academic activities for students. In addition, if a path is defined within the VL, a program can be generated for a real robot to follow that path. © 2020 ACM.","educational innovation, higher education, industrial robots, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Similarly, in higher education, programs are redefined to allow students to gain communicative and cooperative competences to qualify them for their professional work and the role they will play in society, however, there is a lack of specific guidelines on learning strategies and tools that promote acquisition and development of these competences. An empirical study is shown to examine how an online learning environment developed from scratch throughout several years and based on web-based resources such as virtual laboratories, interactive activities, educational videos, and a game-based learning methodology combines with active learning, which might impact the student's relationships and cooperative competence development. As a result, a case study was carried out through a virtual learning environment. It was created to motivate and to facilitate students' involvement. The analysis was conducted based on the data collected from a core subject of the Computer Engineering and Information Systems degree courses. The answers of an online survey (n=289) were examined by using the structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results obtained show that the use of this learning environment have a significant and positive impact on the two dimensions of relational coordination; communication and relationships.

Firstly, the study reviews the general concept and algorithm of synchronous generator model. Secondly, the simulation method of this system is discussed. Finally, the paper introduces its example and analysis. One of the major objectives of this project is the dynamics of synchronous generators connected to the 500 kV EHV Jamali (Jawa-Madura-Bali) System under unbalanced steady state condition that could be modeled as a balanced synchronous generator's model with unbalanced voltage inputs. The balanced synchronous generator model based on the rotor's qd0 reference frame was chosen to substitute generator's model embeded in loadflow analysis. The verification of the proposed generator's model was checked by comparing it with a PSS Tecquiment NE9070 simulator. The unbalanced voltage inputs of generator were derived utilizing the loadflow analysis by determining the phase and sequence currents, and average bus voltages of the 500 kV EHV Jamali grid considering unbalanced portion variations.

Hence, laboratory is as important as theory; however, the ill-equipped laboratory facilities affect the students’ learnability. The virtual laboratories may help the students overcome the problems faced by them in the conventional laboratory. In India, educational activities during the middle of the semester were affected due to lockdown related to COVID-19. However, the theory classes were conducted online, and educational institutions are finding it difficult to complete the laboratory experiments due to closure of colleges for the students due to COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we have conducted a faculty development programme for the engineering college faculty members on mechanical engineering virtual laboratories. Similarly, we have trained the mechanical engineering students on fluid mechanics virtual laboratory. We have taken feedback from the participants of these virtual laboratory training programme and analysed it. From the analysis we have observed that more than 90 per cent of the participants were happy about the virtual laboratory and they expressed that their learning process improved with virtual laboratory experiments.

Virtual laboratories (vLABs) are a potential means to enable interactive learning experiences. A vLAB focusing on Western Blotting was developed and implemented in a 3rd year undergraduate Pathology course for science students to facilitate learning of technical molecular laboratory skills that are linked to development of diagnostic skills. Such skills are important for undergraduates in building a conceptual understanding of translation of laboratory techniques to changes in human biology due to disease. Methods: The Western Blotting vLAB was developed and deployed using the Adaptive eLearning Platform (AeLP) developed by Smart Sparrow (https://www.smartsparrow.com/). The vLAB was evaluated to assess students' perceptions of their laboratory skills relevant to the diagnosis of Muscular Dystrophy. A blended learning rotation model was applied in which wet laboratory and vLAB environments for Western Blotting were both delivered to three consecutive cohorts of 3rd year science undergraduates undertaking a Muscle Diseases practical class. Evaluation questionnaires were administered at the completion of the practical classes. Results: Students indicated in online questionnaires that the Western Blotting vLAB was at least equivalent to the real lab in their perceived development of concepts, laboratory skills and diagnosis of disease. Conclusions: vLABs have great potential for improving students' development of diagnostic skills.

However, the physically distributed nature of data resources and of expertise in advanced analytical tools creates many challenges for the modern scientist. Across the wider biological sciences, presenting such capabilities on the Internet (as ""Web services"") and using scientific workflow systems to compose them for particular tasks is a practical way to carry out robust ""in silico"" science. However, use of this approach in biodiversity science and ecology has thus far been quite limited. Results: BioVeL is a virtual laboratory for data analysis and modelling in biodiversity science and ecology, freely accessible via the Internet. BioVeL includes functions for accessing and analysing data through curated Web services; for performing complex in silico analysis through exposure of R programs, workflows, and batch processing functions; for on-line collaboration through sharing of workflows and workflow runs; for experiment documentation through reproducibility and repeatability; and for computational support via seamless connections to supporting computing infrastructures. We developed and improved more than 60 Web services with significant potential in many different kinds of data analysis and modelling tasks. We composed reusable workflows using these Web services, also incorporating R programs. Deploying these tools into an easy-to-use and accessible 'virtual laboratory', free via the Internet, we applied the workflows in several diverse case studies. We opened the virtual laboratory for public use and through a programme of external engagement we actively encouraged scientists and third party application and tool developers to try out the services and contribute to the activity. Conclusions: Our work shows we can deliver an operational, scalable and flexible Internet-based virtual laboratory to meet new demands for data processing and analysis in biodiversity science and ecology. In particular, we have successfully integrated existing and popular tools and practices from different scientific disciplines to be used in biodiversity and ecological research. © 2016 The Author(s).","Analysis, automation, Biodiversity science, Biodiversity virtual e-laboratory, Computing software, data processing, Ecology, Informatics, virtual laboratory, workflows",0,1,0,1

Existing solutions for managing data typically use unstructured file systems or relational databases. These systems are not designed to provide instantaneous response to user queries. Furthermore, they do not support rapid data analysis and visualization to enable interactive experiments. In large scale experiments, this behaviour slows research discovery, discourages the widespread sharing and reuse of data that could otherwise inform critical decisions in a timely manner and encourage effective collaboration between groups. Results: In this paper we present SensorDB, a web based virtual laboratory that can manage large volumes of biological time series sensor data while supporting rapid data queries and real-time user interaction. SensorDB is sensor agnostic and uses web-based, state-of-the-art cloud and storage technologies to efficiently gather, analyse and visualize data.

In this way, Go-Lab enables inquiry-based learning that promotes acquisition of deep conceptual domain knowledge and inquiry skills, with the further intent of interesting students in careers in science. For students, Go-Lab offers the opportunity to perform scientific experiments with online labs in pedagogically structured learning spaces. Go-Lab’s inquiry learning spaces (ILSs) structure the students’ inquiry process through an inquiry cycle and provide students with guidance in which dedicated (and connected) scaffolds for inquiry processes play a pivotal role. Teachers can create and adapt inquiry learning phases and the associated guidance in an ILS through a simple wiki-like interface and can add scaffolds and tools to an ILS using a straightforward drag and drop feature. Teachers can also adapt scaffolds and tools (e.g., change the language or the concepts available in a concept mapper) through an “app composer”. In creating ILSs, teachers are supported by scenarios and associated defaults ILSs that can be used as a starting point for development. In addition, teachers are offered a community framework to disseminate best practices and find mutual support. For lab-owners, Go-Lab provides open interfacing solutions for easily plugging in their online labs and sharing them in the Go-Lab federation of online labs. In its first year, Go-Lab created ILSs for thirteen online labs from different lab providers, including renowned research organizations (e.g., CERN, ESA) that participate in the consortium. The design of these inquiry learning spaces has been evaluated through mock-ups and prototypes with students and teachers. More advanced and later versions will be evaluated and validated in large scale pilots. The sustainability of Go-Lab will come from the opportunity for the larger science education community to add new online labs and share ILSs.

In the area of education, self-efficacy plays a crucial role in causing behavioral changes, resulting in enhanced performance over the course of learning. In chemistry education, students often develop anxiety towards performing experiments due to the perceived negative outcomes resulting from lack of understanding and improper experimentation. This anxiety negatively impacts the self-efficacy of students in performing laboratory experiments. We define student-held beliefs about their experimental skills as ’experimental self-efficacy’ (ESE), and examine the four prominent factors that impact ESE in chemical laboratories. Through the development of an instrument, this work characterizes ESE and the impact of pre-laboratory interventions such as exposure to virtual laboratories (VL) on ESE and conceptual knowledge of students. Furthermore, analysis using statistical techniques such as t-tests and dissimilarity matrices reveal the positive impact of VL in enhancing students’ ESE. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anxiety, Chemistry, Conceptual learning, Physical laboratory, Self-efficacy, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

Anyhow, in the field of Computer Science, Technology and Engineering these learning environments are still relatively behind when discussing new technologies like distance learning.

The equivalent virtual laboratory can be based on remote access to real lab equipment or can be represented by a fully-software virtual replica. The Internet of Things (IoT) concept describes the connection between various physical devices into a global network, along with their identification and information share. The growth of the IoT technology expands the communication capability to, and all the data makes it alive. Perhaps the most used educational approach sharing the same idea with IoT is the concept of a remote or virtual laboratory. In this case, things are instruments and processes involved in laboratory experiments. This virtual environment provides a connection with dedicated hardware controlled via the Internet, and it often uses other network services. In this paper, the main research activity regards both software and hardware deployment criteria of a virtual laboratory used for educational purposes.

The recently acquired data have grown to 7 gigabytes per shot, 10 times bigger than estimated before the experiment. In 2006 during 1-h pulse experiments, 90 gigabytes of data was acquired, a new world record. This data explosion has been enabled by the massively distributed processing architecture and the newly developed capability of realtime streaming acquisition. The former provides linear expandability since increasing the number of parallel DAQs avoids I/O bottlenecks. The latter improves the unit performance from 0.7 megabytes/s in conventional CAM AC digitizers to nonstop 110 megabytes/s in CompactPCI. The technical goal of this system is to be able to handle one hundred 100 megabytes/s concurrent DAQs even for steady-state plasma diagnostics. This is similar to the data production rate of the next-generation experiments, such as ITER. The LABCOM storage has several hundred terabytes of storage in double-tier structure: The first consists of tens of hard drive arrays, and the second some Blu-ray Disc libraries. Multiplex and redundant storage servers are mandatory for higher availability and throughputs. They together serve sharable volumes on Red Hat GFS2 cluster file systems.

Teachers in Vocational High School (VHS) in Indonesia are expected to bring technology-based innovations to achieve success in learning. Learning facilities are one of the factors supporting the success of learning class. Ideally, Indonesian Vocational High Schools have facilities and infrastructure following industrial. Currently, schools have difficulty providing learning support facilities and infrastructure following those in the industry. Thus, the equipment in the school laboratory is irrelevant to the existing equipment in the industry. The practicum apparatus gap between VHS and industry requires appropriate and effective solutions. The gap occurred in practical learning of micro power generation Indonesian VHS. On the other hand, virtual laboratories in the learning process can help students learn an object that cannot be presented in the classroom. By using virtual laboratories, students learn to use industry apparatus through virtual forms. This research aims to overcome the problem of practical learning in VHS, especially on practical learning of micro power generation through the virtual laboratory. This study used the 4D model approach (Define, Design, Develop, and Disseminate).

Before the distillation, it is common to have a preheating stage, where the crude oil circulates through a heat exchanger in order to increase the temperature around 393K, and then, for its subsequent passage through a methane furnace it reaches a temperature of 793K. The furnace structure has a network of tubes that allows the circulation of crude oil, while a mixture of fuel (methane) and oxygen is burned in order to provide the heat. The paper presents the results of designing and developing a heat exchanger and furnace in a virtual environment in order to represent the preheating process of crude oil that is installed before the distillation tower, as well as mathematical modeling with Laplace transform and Padé approximant to include the delay factor in each thermal process for its further conversion to discrete time by using finite difference method to finally implement discrete PID controllers.

Online sessions and active learning for such courses pose challenges to both teachers and students, especially during this pandemic period. In order to combat these challenges, and to kindle the interest among the students in learning the course, a new methodology which supports blended learning through virtual experience is presented in this paper. The proposed methodology was implemented for the third year engineering students of circuit branches. This paper highlights the effectiveness of using open source emulating environments like Edsim51 and EMU8086 for providing a virtual laboratory experience to the students. These virtual environment provides a complete visualization of the internal functionality of the microprocessor/microcontroller architecture, and also enhances practical exposure of the students. In order to further augment the students’ affinity towards the course, the teacher adopts different pedagogical approaches, which is best suited for ICT based blended learning in the online teaching environment. The assessment of this virtual experience is carried out using different online assessment components such as quizzes, assignments as concept maps/videos shared by the students, mini projects etc. Based on the assessment results, an analysis is carried out and it shows significant improvement in student engagement, in depth understanding of the course and improvement in programming skills of the students. Thus, this experience not only acts as a countermeasure to the lack of real time laboratory sessions but also promotes ‘understanding by doing’, which seems almost impossible during this pandemic situation. © 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

This need arises even within educational institutions, where investments in the development of technologies to support collaborative distance learning are still trivial. Most CAD programs used in engineering have modules for collaboration. However, these solutions are expensive, especially for educational institutions that have a large number of students. The mentioned modules generally work within a specific CAD platform and support import and export of a limited number of CAD formats. In this paper, we present an open-source solution that overcomes these problems. It implements practical work at a distance by combining most commonly used CAD platforms in engineering. In this paper, we describe how to use virtual laboratory for rapid designing through execution of practical exercises. The architecture of the proposed solution, the modelling of the laboratory and methods for creating its functions are described. Also, given is a tangible example of collaborative aircraft assembly between distant students, with parts modelled in different CAD packages, and the usability of labs presented through prototype builds on 3D printer and the final test in the wind tunnel.

A virtual laboratory is implemented for the provision of training environments for practical exercises. Tele-Lab uses virtual machine (VM) technology and virtual network devices. A VM is used to represent a physical computer in an exercise scenario. While every VM needs a specific resource allocation, availability and scalability of Tele-lab become an issue. Scaling out Tele-Lab to a public cloud is one alternative to making it more available and scalable. Public clouds are very flexible in providing resources since customers can add or reduce resources whenever needed. A second alternative is the reduction of resources needed for a single training environment, e.g. by replacing the virtualization technology in Tele-Lab with the one that uses fewer resources than full-fledged virtual machines. A container uses far fewer resources than a virtual machine. The paper at hand elaborates on the use of containers (i.e. Docker) in the training environment of a man in the middle (MITM) attack and Firewall learning units, designed to replace VMs. This work is part of the continuous improvement on Tele-Lab to make it more reliable and more scalable. © 2016 International Journal of Learning and Teaching.

It has been used to investigate imaging system's sensitivity, data acquisition methods, or image reconstruction algorithms. The GATE system, based on the Monte Carlo method, operates relying on user-provided scripts that follow the program definitions in the system's command library. Script-writing is usually time-consuming and frequently error-associated unless one has had certain experience in the simulation field and is familiar with programming. This is obviously an obstacle to students and beginners. The learning curve of script-writing is relatively flat to nonprogramming background learners. In addition, the GATE system is commonly installed on a high-performance computer, on which the scripts are usually compiled and used by the user only. In order to utilize GATE's potential to be a routine simulation toolkit, we have developed QGATE, a GUI-based GATE system. The QGATE system provides users a graphical environment where a simulation design is achieved by fashions like ""drag-and-drop objects"" and ""choose-and-modify parameters"". The scripts will be automatically generated and complied by the system. Parameters belonging to each object have default values so as to avoid errors induced by new users. The QGATE system consists of one or more QGATE Clients and one QGATE Server. The Client can be installed on individual computers so that multiple users can work on their simulation projects simultaneously by using the graphical designing tools. The Server is installed on the same computer as the GATE system resides. The Server manages the submitted simulation scripts queued by a job ticket and returns the job finish signal to the corresponding client. The QGATE system is suitable for classroom training and easy to use for students or new users to the field of nuclear medicine imaging simulation. © Li and Zhao.","GUI, PET, Server-client, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1
10.22323/1.293.0015,Data Provenance Tracking as the Basis for a Biomedical Virtual Research Environment,International Symposium on Grids and Clouds,2017,Conference Paper,"In complex data analyses it is increasingly important to capture information about the usage of data sets in addition to their preservation over time to ensure reproducibility of results, to verify the work of others and to ensure appropriate conditions data have been used for specific analyses. Scientific workflow based studies are beginning to realize the benefit of capturing this provenance of data and the activities used to process, transform and carry out studies on those data. This is especially true in biomedicine where the collection of data through experiment is costly and/or difficult to reproduce and where that data needs to be preserved over time. One way to support the development of workflows and their use in (collaborative) biomedical analyses is through the use of a Virtual Research Environment. The dynamic and distributed nature of Grid/Cloud computing, however, makes the capture and processing of provenance information a major research challenge. Furthermore most workflow provenance management services are designed only for data-flow oriented workflows and researchers are now realising that tracking data or workflows alone or separately is insufficient to support the scientific process. What is required for collaborative research is traceable and reproducible provenance support in a full orchestrated Virtual Research Environment (VRE) that enables researchers to define their studies in terms of the datasets and processes used, to monitor and visualize the outcome of their analyses and to log their results so that others users can call upon that acquired knowledge to support subsequent studies. We have extended the work carried out in the neuGRID and N4U projects in providing a so-called Virtual Laboratory to provide the foundation for a generic VRE in which sets of biomedical data (images, laboratory test results, patient records, epidemiological analyses etc.) and the workflows (pipelines) used to process those data, together with their provenance data and results sets are captured in the CRISTAL software.

Inclusion of new technology and complexity into the airspace increases the importance and difficulty of safety assurance. Additionally, testing new technologies on complex aviation systems and systems of systems can be challenging, expensive, and at at times unsafe when implementing real life scenarios. The application of prognostics to aviation and airspace management may produce new tools and insight into these problems. Prognostic methodology provides an estimate of the health and risks of a component, vehicle, or airspace and knowledge of how that will change over time. That measure is especially useful in safety determination, mission planning, and maintenance scheduling. In our research, we develop a live, distributed, hardwarein-the-loop Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed for aviation and airspace prognostics. The developed testbed will be used to validate prediction algorithms for the real-time safety monitoring of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the prediction of unsafe events. In our earlier work1 we discussed the initial Prognostics Virtual Laboratory testbed development work and related results for milestones 1 & 2 . This paper describes the design, development, and testing of the integrated tested which are part of milestone 3, along with our next steps for validation of this work. Through a framework consisting of software/hardware modules and associated interface clients, the distributed testbed enables safe, accurate, and inexpensive experimentation and research into airspace and vehicle prognosis that would not have been possible otherwise. The testbed modules can be used cohesively to construct complex and relevant airspace scenarios for research. Four modules are key to this research: the virtual aircraft module which uses the X-Plane simulator and X-PlaneConnect toolbox, the live aircraft module which connects fielded aircraft using onboard cellular communications devices, the hardware in the loop (HITL) module which connects laboratory based bench-top hardware testbeds and the research module which contains diagnostics and prognostics tools for analysis of live air traffic situations and vehicle health conditions. The testbed also features other modules for data recording and playback, information visualization, and air traffic generation.

10.25304/rlt.v28.2419,A chemistry laboratory platform enhanced with virtual reality for students’ adaptive learning,Research in Learning Technology,2020,Article,"In recent years, virtual reality system (VRS) has become more prominent among many researchers due to its capacity of providing as close as possible to real-life experience for users from diverse fields of life, such as tourism, academics, manufacturing and medicine. In this study, we present an VRS for the titration experiment in a chemistry laboratory to enable students to learn the titration experiment in a virtual laboratory environment before proceeding to the chemistry wet lab. The virtual chemistry laboratory environment was developed using the Unity Real-Time Development Platform, and the Microsoft SQL Server was used for the database to enable easy assessment of the student performance after the exper-iment. To evaluate our VRS, we tested it among 50 students (25 high school and 25 first-year undergraduate chemistry students). We collate their user’s experience through a structured questionnaire, and the responses from the students show that 60% agreed that it was helpful, 66% easy to interact with and 54% strongly agreed that it improved learning. Therefore, it is evidence that the proposed VR-enabled chemistry laboratory platform could be used to improve the understanding of chemistry titration practical process among students. © 2020 O. C.

10.29074/ascls.25.4.224,Using online instruction and virtual laboratories to teach hemostasis in a medical laboratory science program.,American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science,2012,Article,"Hemostasis laboratory testing methods have changed significantly over the past decades, from totally manual, to fully automated methodologies. Most medical laboratory educators prefer to use manual or semiautomated methods to teach hemostasis so that students can ""see"" what is occurring during the testing method, but many semi-automated instruments are no longer commercially available or are not cost-effective for education programs. In consideration of these factors and due to programmatic expansion to a coordinate campus, the CLS program explored new ways to teach hemostasis methods equitably and affordably across two distant locations. Working with an instructional design team versed in online education, five virtual hemostasis laboratory exercises were created that mimic the manual methodologies. Web-based didactic instruction was also developed to teach the testing theory and pathophysiology related to patient results. The efficacy of the virtual instruction was evaluated through assessment of student performance on exam questions, professional certification scores for the platelet/hemostasis sub-category, student satisfaction surveys, and evaluation of student performance during their clinical experience. Results showed that students in the virtual delivery format performed significantly better on exam questions compared to the traditional delivery method group, but there was no significant difference in their performance on the professional certification exam. Both student and preceptor feedback have been positive on the value of the exercises for students' understanding of hemostasis.","Hemostasis, virtual laboratory instruction, online education",0,1,0,1

But unfortunately the closed loop experiments are way too often limited to these virtual domains and the students lack the physical feedback about the impact of control algorithms and its parameters. The reasons might be the price of the hardware setup to demonstrate the control algorithms physically or a complicated transition from simulation to real-time platform. This paper describes an extremely inexpensive, straightforward and surprisingly powerful platform for implementation of real-time control algorithms. The platform consists of an Arduino board and a Raspberry Pi running the REX Control System. The Arduino board is used for interaction with the physical world via its inputs and outputs. The REX Control System allows the students to develop and verify the control algorithms in Simulink and then run it in real-time by a few mouse clicks. However, the REX Control System is by no means dependent on Simulink, it is fully functional even if Simulink license is not available. The platform further bridges the gap between the virtual and physical worlds as it is tightly connected to PIDlab.com and Contlab.eu portals, which makes it an ideal choice for control education purposes. © IFAC.","Closed-loop control, control education, Control equipment, Real-time",0,1,0,1

The so-called virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) which are used to support university classes are significantly affected by this technological obsolescence, decreasing their formative effectiveness as the obsolescence process advances. In this study, the technological obsolescence of two VRLEs is analyzed by means of an empirical research based on survey results (N = 135) after using the VRLEs in engineering classes. Several key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed during seven academic courses, including motivation, interactivity, ease of use and usefulness. Since both VRLEs were updated during this research work, the influence of these improvements is discussed in detail from a technological obsolescence point of view. Results suggest that the technological obsolescence negatively affects the students' opinion regarding motivation and interactivity, but the other KPIs (ease of use and usefulness) are hardly affected. In contrast, results indicate that the technological obsolescence can be reversed if periodic updates of educational tools are carried out using modern development software. © 2020 by the author.

These activities are more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, etc. Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages, such as (1) promoting critical thinking and (2) improving students’ abilities and skills for their professional careers. There are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and gamebased platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based educational platform, which defines a modular and flexible architecture (using light containers). This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent way. The platform uses gamification to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms, so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve this goal, we first focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide implementation guidelines for efficient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project, which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the educational potential of these virtual environments (e.g., virtual laboratories) is of particular interest to a wider scientific community, with numerous successful examples coming from different fields, starting from social sciences, to STEM disciplines. However, when it comes to agent theory, which is a highly important part of the general AI (Artificial Intelligence) research focus, there is a noticeable absence of such educational tools. To be more precise, there is a certain lack of virtual educational systems dedicated primarily to agents. That was the motivation for the development of the AViLab (Agents Virtual Laboratory) gamified system, as a demonstration tool for educational purposes in the related subject of agent theory. The developed system is thoroughly described in this paper. The current version of the AViLab consists of several agents (developed according to the agenda elaborated in the manuscript), aiming to demonstrate certain insights into fundamental agent structures. Although the task imposed to our agents essentially represents a sort of “picking” or “collecting” task, the scenario in the system is rather gamified, in order to be more immersive for potential users, spectators, or possible test subjects. This kind of task was chosen because of its wide applicability in both, gaming scenarios and real-world everyday scenarios. In order to demonstrate how AViLab can be utilized, we conducted an exemplar experiment, described in the paper. Alongside its educational purpose, the AViLab system also has the potential to be used for research purposes in the related subjects of agent theory, AI, and game AI, especially regarding future system extensions (including the introduction of new scenarios, more advanced agents, etc.). © 2022 by the authors.

This increases efficiency and ensures that the user experiences at least 60 frames per second, thus reducing lagging and creating a pleasant experience for the user. We conduct two leveling examples, a three-benchmark loop and a point-to-point leveling line. Both surveys had a misclosure of 1 mm due to observational random errors, which demonstrated that leveling can be conducted with mm-level precision, much like in the physical world. © 2021 by the authors.","engineering education, Immersive and interactive, Surveying, virtual laboratories, virtual reality",0,1,0,1
10.3390/info11030132,A genericweblab control tuning experience using the ball and beam process and multiobjective optimization approach,Information,2020,Article,"In control engineering education, the possibility of using a real control system in the learning process motivates professors to improve both students' knowledge and skills, thus avoiding an approach only based on control theory. While considering that control engineering laboratories are expensive, mainly because educational plants should reproduce classical problems that are found in the industry, the use of virtual laboratories appears as an interesting strategy for reducing costs and improving the diversity of experiments. In this research, remote experimentation was assumed regarding the ball and beam process as an alternative didactic methodology. While assuming a nonlinear and unstable open-loop process, this study presents how students should proceed to control the plant focusing on the topic that is associated with multiobjective optimization. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller was tuned considering the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to illustrate the WebLab learning procedures described in this research. The proposed strategy was compared to the Astrom's robust loop shaping method to emphasize the performance of the multiobjective optimization technique. Analyzing the feedback provided by the students, remote experimentation can be seen as an interesting approach for the future of engineering learning, once it can be directly associated with industry demand of connected machines and real-time information analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","advanced control, Ball and beam process, control engineering education, multiobjective optimization, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

10.3390/rs12111795,The VLab framework: An orchestrator component to support data to knowledge transition,Remote Sensing,2020,Article,"Over the last decades, to better proceed towards global and local policy goals, there was an increasing demand for the scientific community to support decision-makers with the best available knowledge. Scientific modeling is key to enable the transition from data to knowledge, often requiring to process big datasets through complex physical or empirical (learning-based AI) models. Although cloud technologies provide valuable solutions for addressing several of the Big Earth Data challenges, model sharing is still a complex task. The usual approach of sharing models as services requires maintaining a scalable infrastructure which is often a very high barrier for potential model providers. This paper describes the Virtual Earth Laboratory (VLab), a software framework orchestrating data and model access to implement scientific processes for knowledge generation. The VLab lowers the entry barriers for both developers and users. It adopts mature containerization technologies to access models as source code and to rebuild the required software environment to run them on any supported cloud. This makes VLab fitting in the multi-cloud landscape, which is going to characterize the Big Earth Data analytics domain in the next years. The VLab functionalities are accessible through APIs, enabling developers to create new applications tailored to end-users. © 2020 by the authors.","Data to knowledge, Environmental modeling, Geospatial technology, interoperability, Orchestration, Virtual earth laboratory",0,1,0,1

However, performing experiments in real conditions is usually expensive in terms of time, money and energy, as it requires expensive infrastructures that are generally difficult to maintain in good conditions. To overcome this problem, virtual reality has proven to be a powerful tool to achieve sustainability, making it easy to update laboratories without the need to acquire new equipment. Moreover, the ability to introduce practical knowledge into classrooms without leaving them, makes virtual laboratories capable of simulating typical operating environments as well as extreme situations in the operation of different devices. A typical subject in which students can benefit from the use of virtual laboratories is robotics. In this work we will develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) pedagogical simulator of industrial robotic arms for engineering students. With the proposed system, students will know the effects of their own designed trajectories on several different robotic arms and cell environments without having to buy all of them and being safe of damaging the cell components. The simulation will be checking for collisions of the elements in the scene and alert the student when they happen. This can be achieved with a robotic simulator, but the integration with immersive VR is intended to help students better understand robotics. Moreover, even having a real robotic arm available for students, with this proposed VR method, all the students have the opportunity to manage and learn his own version of the robotic cell, without waiting times generated by having less robotic arms than students in classroom. © 2018 by the authors.","education, Pedagogy, robotics, simulations, virtual reality",0,1,0,1

Both the developed and developing countries will have to face increasing challenges to match the greater demand of clean and safe water, looking for supplies far from the residential area. This situation will be furtherly exasperated by the effects of climate change which, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events, will reduce the availability and the quality of water resources and will subject the population to serious and ongoing hazards. In such context, an accurate and continuous monitoring of surface waters represents a fundamental step to reduce the contamination status and plan actions for a sustainable management of this resource. In the last years, the development of advanced methodologies and high-tech equipment able to lower the times and costs of the field surveys has not been associated with an appropriate training of the technical staff of public and private bodies responsible for the control of the territory. In most cases, unable to outsource highly qualified personnel due to lack of funding, such bodies tend to reduce the monitoring activities, leaving the areas even more subject to the risk of disastrous events. The present paper proposes an innovative educational tool based on the virtual reality in support to technical and non-technical workforces in field activities. The tool represents a Virtual Laboratory able to train on the standard techniques for the accurate monitoring of the water discharge in open-channel flows and was successfully tested on a sample of people from the private and public water sector. According to the results, its use increased the fieldworkers' ability to quickly move within the river as well as to easily and correctly manage the measurement equipment and methodology, so reducing the costs and times of surveys in situ. © 2020 by the authors.","Field survey, Mobile fieldworkers, Professional training, Sustainable water management, virtual reality laboratory, Water discharge monitoring",0,1,0,1

Moreover, the possibility of virtual laboratories opens new perspectives for higher education sustainability. They are a perfect approach for training learners to understand scientific principles in many fields of science by offering them the possibility to illustrate the scientific phenomena through automated and virtual practical activities that employ computer simulation. In this work, we present the use of computer simulation combined with the JavaScript programming language for the development of a low-cost virtual laboratory integrated into an interactive learning environment based on the Moodle platform. The methodology was based on the instructional design model ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation), which structures the development planning of online teaching resources in different stages (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation). The virtual laboratory was developed by Moroccan universities, with the help of European partners, and it was implemented in the 12 science faculties in Morocco. It presents a great choice for supporting laboratory activities for learners in the first year of their bachelor’s degree program. This virtual laboratory includes 12 virtual practical activities mapped to the physics curriculum, and they can be operated via the Internet on computers. The proposed virtual learning environment was evaluated by teachers and learners from the science faculties.

This technology has also made its way to the field of education in the form of virtual laboratories. A lack of student engagement and interest towards STEM subjects is reported in the literature. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate virtual reality in education, but these studies are limited in terms of participants and subject coverage. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual laboratories to develop student’s practical learning skills for secondary school physics. For this purpose, a desktop-based virtual laboratory application was developed based on the guidelines extracted from the literature. A user study was adopted as the main research method, and it was conducted with 184 students of 4 different schools. In each school, students were divided into two groups: experimental (used the virtual laboratory application) and control (used a physical laboratory). The data were collected through an academic quiz conducted at the end of the study. The mean score of the experimental group was 7.16, compared with 5.87 for the control group. The results revealed that the students’ learning using the virtual laboratory application was better compared with the control group. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the performance of boys and girls in both groups. The usability questionnaire was also completed by 92 students of the experimental group to assess the application interface. The mean score was 73.5 (above average) with an internal consistency of 0.76.

Among these technologies, photovoltaic energy, which produces clean electricity from the Sun, is the one that has grown faster, and its implementation all over the world is a guarantee of a solid and efficient energy technology. Nevertheless, in order to design very efficient solar energy systems, it is crucial to have a good solar radiation database. There are databases where it is possible to find information on solar radiation, but only for horizontal surfaces. Afterwards, it is necessary to transform the horizontal solar radiation data to tilt solar radiation data. This transformation is not easy, and the application of complex mathematical equations, and expressions, and difficult algorithms must be done. An application called virtual laboratory ""OrientSol 3.0"" which allows the user to easily obtain the solar radiation for any tilt surface has been developed by us. Thus, our main objectives in this paper are to present the developed virtual laboratory and to explain its main features and core functionalities. In order to point out the difficulties and complexity of the transformation of horizontal solar radiation data to tilt solar radiation data, we will present some examples of the results this application provides and compare the solar radiation data supplied with this application with some other solar radiation data obtained from other databases. © 2017 by the author.","Energy harvesting, Generated energy, Solar photovoltaic system, solar radiation, Transformation",0,1,0,1

Since the web inception two decades ago, there are multiple initiatives to connect, aggregate, share, and publish biodiversity data, and to establish data and work flows in order to analyze them. The European program LifeWatch aims at establishing a distributed network of nodes implementing virtual research environment in Europe to facilitate the work of biodiversity researchers and managers. LifeWatchGreece is one of these nodes where a portal was developed offering access to a suite of virtual laboratories and e-services. New information Despite its strict definition in information technology, in practice ""portal"" is a fairly broad term that embraces many web architectures. In the biodiversity domain, the term ""portal"" is usually used to indicate either a web site that provides access to a single or an aggregation of data repositories (like: http://indiabiodiversity.org/, http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org/, http://data.freshwaterbiodiversity.eu), a web site that gathers information about various online biodiversity tools (like http://test-eubon.ebd.csic.es/, http://marine.lifewatch.eu/) or a web site that just gathers information and news about the biodiversity domain (like http:// chm.moew.government.bg). LifeWatchGreece's portal takes the concept of a portal a step further. In strict IT terms, LifeWatchGreece's portal is partly a portal, partly a platform and partly an aggregator. It includes a number of biodiversity-related web tools integrated into a centrally-controlled software ecosystem. This ecosystem includes subsystems for access control, traffic monitoring, user notifications and web tool management. These subsystems are shared to all the web tools that have been integrated to the portal and thereby are part of this ecosystem. These web tools do not consist in external and completely independent web applications as it happens in most other portals. A quite obvious (to the user) indication of this is the Single-Sign-On (SSO) functionality for all tools and the common user interface wrapper that most of these tools use.

Practical experiments are not possible for clarification, since important quantities in the mathematical formulation can only made visible in experiments with extreme effort or are even inaccessible like theoretical constructs or infinitesimal values. Numerical calculations may be used to show some quantities, but students cannot carry them out for themselves. Therefore, a virtual-reality laboratory for fluid mechanics is created with the software Unreal Engine 4. This enables the students to learn the derivation of conservation laws and to influence the flow in order to experience and examine the basics of theoretical constructs.

In this paper we exploit Jini Technologies to design and implement a distributed architecture for a virtual lab oriented for supporting the activities of an Electronic Measurement Course. The aim of this environment is offering to the students the opportunity to experiment a real interaction with the laboratory's instruments everywhere and every time. The environment offers services that allow the remotely programming of the instruments and manages the multi-access to the various tools. A prototype of the architecture and its services will be discussed and an evaluation campaign will be showed.","distributed systems, e-learning, Trial and error approach, virtual labs",0,1,0,1

The deployment of these laboratories must manage several aspects related to the real use of them, as user's authorization and access, tracking of usage information, loading/saving data from experiments and so on. These features must be implemented by developers in a particular way for each laboratory. This paper shows how these services can be used automatically, with no development, using the RELATED management services. The deployment task consists of making a connector to the RELATED framework in order to consume these services.

Virtual laboratories, which use computer technology to perform experiments utilizing virtual instrumentation instead of physical devices, are warmly welcomed for its low-cost advantage, 24/7 operation, remotely accessibility and sharing features. In this paper, a DC motor control system which can be used to carry out the experiments of position control in real time based on NCSLab framework is presented. After describing the process of 3D modelling, rendering in Flash 3D engine and control algorithms that are generated using Matlab Real-Time Workshop, a position control experiment is conducted and the experimental results are demonstrated as an example. For most virtual control laboratories, users are only allowed to design the algorithms and then monitor the control results. However, wiring process which is also an important part of practical control experiments cannot be emulated. To address this problem, a new experiment modelling method which allows the users to do the wiring in the 3D real-time virtual laboratory is proposed in this paper. It could make users feel more sense of reality and immersion when performing the virtual experiments.","3D virtual laboratory, control algorithm, DC motor, real-time experiments, Wiring",0,1,0,1

10.3991/ijoe.v12i03.5462,A built-up virtual laboratory to enhance understanding of concrete structure design requirement,International Journal of Online and Biomedical Engineering,2016,Article,"In this paper, simulation tools for educational purposes are developed to enhance understanding in undergraduate students taking courses related to concrete structural behavior. As undergraduate students learn about concrete structure, they commonly reach limits regarding their understanding of failure behavior in materials. Design codes should therefore be followed when students learn about reinforced concrete (RC) design. Students are able to follow a step-by-step design procedure for a RC beam using simple calculations. However, they usually then face some requirement, such as a design code, that requires students to make an RC beam with several pieces of rebar instead of one piece, because this provides a more desirable behavior for the RC structure. Understanding why the code is required needs more than just reading. By conducting an experiment, students can easily understand the reason for the code. However, real experiments for concrete structures are time-consuming and costly; therefore, provision of a realistic simulation tool, the 'Virtual Concrete Structure Laboratory,' for engineering educational purposes allows students to obtain virtual hands-on experience to learn about concrete structure. The main purpose of this paper is to show the effectiveness of this virtual lab in civil engineering education.","Concrete structural behavior, hands-on experience, Reinforced concrete structure, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

The education sector is the particular sector which has been getting the influence to implement more advanced teaching methods, and this can be seen through the application of the monitoring system, remote control, and even data acquisition through the Internet. Therefore, this study demonstrates the development of the interactive system via the Internet for the remote access to the equipment known as LD-Didactic temperature system which is used in the laboratory. This particular system is developed using an Arduino-Espresso8266 and LabVIEW platform which is integrated with Blynk software in order to remotely control the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) setting. Furthermore, the proposed framework is specifically focused on the PID temperature control system, which allows students to learn and simulate the concept of the control scheme by adjusting suitable parameter gains. Moreover, the system evaluation demonstrates the functionality and ability of direct controlling, monitoring, and tracking in order to achieve the targeted temperature control.

Teaching computer network subjects to be easily understood by students needs an instructional media as a tool in delivering material. This media uses computer virtualization technology, i.e. creating a virtual laboratory, as a means of students in conducting experiments from the material that has been obtained. In virtual laboratories it is possible to implement network topology designs based on actual network topologies. This implementation is used as a testing tool before the network topology is implemented on the actual network. Therefore, errors can be identified first without disturbing the system that is already running. For testing, the students are given training using a basic network design consisting of the implementation of routing tests, firewalls, ftp server implementation and web server. This paper is aimed at describing ways to develop a virtual laboratory with a network emulator environment using NetKit. Moreover, several exercises on network topology implementation that are applied directly to the real world with NetKit are introduced, such as describing laboratory settings, describing the main parts of the lab, illustrating lab instructions, and reporting lab feeds. © 2019.","computer networks, learning media, Netkit, Network design, virtual laboratories",0,1,0,1

This often means that the understanding of the physical interrelationships is left out in the cold. Practical experiments are often unsuitable for clarification, since important quantities in the mathematical formulation cannot be made visible in experiments (or only with extreme effort). Numerical calculations may show these quantities, but students cannot carry them out for themselves. For this purpose, the software Unreal engine 4 is used to create a virtual environment for fluid mechanics and compared with other methods to improve the teaching of the fundamentals of fluid mechanics. The virtual environment enables the students to influence the flow in order to experience and examine the basic physical effects.

However in the implementation, many obstacles are often encountered in a conventional laboratory such as lack of materials, tools, and times which make it less optimal. Evidently these issues could be solved by employing Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Thus far VR makes great contributions especially to the education sector. One of them is through combining it in the process of developing virtual laboratory. Virtual laboratory played an important role in the learning process specifically in terms of laboratory works. It was possible to manipulate 2D (virtual world) objects similar to 3D (real world) objects. This study developed Virtual Reality Laboratory (VRL) to analyze its characteristics, quality, and impact on students' cognitive achievement. A research and development (R&D) method with a post-test design was applied in this study. The subjects of this study were 102 high school students in class XI. The samples were divided into 3 classes, namely CC (real laboratory); EC-1 (VRL); and EC-2 (real laboratory and VRL). The findings of students' cognitive achievement were analyzed using ANOVA and it was found that there were significant differences in students' cognitive achievement in those three classes. Students who used VRL had higher cognitive achievement than students who used the conventional one. VRL also received excellent grades from chemistry educators. Thus, VRL is very useful as a supplement in the teaching and learning process. © 2021, International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

Taking this into account, an interactive virtual platform (IVP) is presented in this paper for enhancing students' self-learning of one of the most commonly used in engineering material tests: the compression test for concrete samples. In order to carry out such innovative teaching approach, a computational modeling of a virtual materials laboratory was developed including an interactive compression test machine. This way, by using this IVP, students can freely interact with the virtual compression machine during out of class study time. According to this approach, the aim of this computational application is essentially didactic, since (i) this tool allows students to get familiar with concrete compression test and, in this way, (ii) the knowledge acquired by means of such tool can be really useful for improving the students' learning performance during their later pressential laboratory practices. © 2014 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Concrete compression tests, engineering education, Interactive virtual platform, virtual laboratory",0,1,0,1

All require the generation of a model grid, preparation and interpolation of topography, initial conditions, and forcing fields. Each task in configuring a regional ocean model is straightforward - but the process of downloading and reformatting data can be time-consuming. For an experienced modeller, the configuration of a new model domain can take as little as a few hours - but for an inexperienced modeller, it can take much longer. In pursuit of technical efficiency, the Australian ocean modelling community has developed the Web-based MARine Virtual Laboratory (WebMARVL). WebMARVL allows a user to quickly and easily configure an ocean general circulation or wave model through a simple interface, reducing the time to configure a regional model to a few minutes. Through WebMARVL, a user is prompted to define the basic options needed for a model configuration, including the model, run duration, spatial extent, and input data. Once all aspects of the configuration are selected, a series of data extraction, reprocessing, and repackaging services are run, and a ""take-away bundle"" is prepared for download. Building on the capabilities developed under Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System, WebMARVL also extracts all of the available observations for the chosen time-space domain. The user is able to download the take-away bundle and use it to run the model of his or her choice. Models supported by WebMARVL include three community ocean general circulation models and two community wave models. The model configuration from the take-away bundle is intended to be a starting point for scientific research. The user may subsequently refine the details of the model set-up to improve the model performance for the given application. In this study, WebMARVL is described along with a series of results from test cases comparing WebMARVL-configured models to observations and manually configured models. It is shown that the automatically configured model configurations produce a good starting point for scientific research. © Author(s) 2016.","Bundle, computer science, Domain (software engineering), simulations, Interface (Java), Process (engineering), grid, Wave model, distributed computing, virtual laboratory, Test case, lcsh:Geology, lcsh:QE1-996.5",0,1,0,1

In addition, outdoor laboratories develop student skills with instruments and surveying techniques. These laboratories are often affected by weather, leading to cancelled laboratories, which reduce the time students spend with instruments and disrupt/delay the academic plan. Furthermore, terrain characteristics are important in surveying, as each terrain and project introduce unique surveying challenges. However, training often takes places in one location, thus, limiting student comprehension and experience on how to use the same instrument and techniques in different terrain conditions. Virtual reality constantly gains ground in education, as it overcomes restrictions of physical laboratories and enhances student learning. This study discusses the development of a leveling laboratory in immersive and interactive virtual reality, as well as the challenges encountered. We have replicated a part of the Penn State Wilkes-Barre campus, where students conduct many of their physical laboratories, in virtual reality with geometric and photorealistic fidelity using remote sensing and photogrammetric methods. Dense point clouds derived from terrestrial laser scanning and small unmanned aerial surveys are used for terrain and man-made object modeling. In addition, we have developed software that simulates surveying instruments, their properties, and user/student interaction with the instrument (e.g., moving the tripod, leveling the level instrument and leveling rod, etc.). This paper demonstrates that by utilizing cutting-edge remote sensing and virtual reality technologies, we can create realistic laboratories that can supplement physical outdoor laboratories and improve/enhance undergraduate instruction of surveying students. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.
