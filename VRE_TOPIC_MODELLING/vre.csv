Led by Clemson University in collaboration with the National Parks Service and Purdue University, OPN is designed to provide a virtual community of professionals in parks and protected areas with the tools, resources, and knowledge base they need to conduct intensive research, perform their jobs duties effectively, and share information with colleagues and users on an international scale. To date, 80,000 of 200,000 archival images and 500,000 out of 2 million bound pages have been digitized from various parks, and a beta version of the platform will be available for demonstration in March 2013. The project includes the integration of a Fedora repository with the Joomla! content management system with extensions to enable GIS functionality, expose metadata as Linked Data and for harvest using OAI-PMH, and enable users to create their own custom collections.","mass digitization, open parks network, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

In the recent past some systems - so called virtual research environments - were presented to support collaborative work restricted to certain research domains. Within this article a concept of a generic framework for building personal, cloud-based virtual research environments easily is proposed. Such an environment could be defined by composing arbitrary services, appropriate to the requirements of a particular scientist. Due to low funds in some scientific areas, we also provide a flexible billing strategy using the cloud specific pay-per-use model. Thus, each service has just to be paid as long as it is utilized. © 2011 IEEE.","cloud computing, Layered Architecture, Pay-per-use, Virtual Collaboration, virtual research environments, virtualization",0,0,1,1

It represents an inventory in process, i.e., updates and new plant species are added every working day. The Flora checklist has an important value for the scientific community, government, industry and society, since it gathers accurate data on flora diversity. Knowing the Brazilian flora has been a commitment assumed by Brazil towards the international community. In 2009, the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, in a joint action with several research institutions, started the development of a Virtual Research Environment based on crowdsourcing. The aim of the project was to support the collaborative and distributed work of an undefined number of pre-qualified trained taxonomists, grouped in their specialties. This article describes the technological aspects related to the ongoing work on the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora, which is a recent example of success in building a knowledge database collaboratively. It describes the mechanisms used for determining individual characteristics of potential participants (target audience), the means of collaboration and communication, as well as the technological platform developed to support a web-based crowdsourcing design for Virtual Research Environment.

Typically, they provide a web-based interface to share documents and data for analysis. However, currently there is no support for earlier stages of research projects in the context of behaviour monitoring such as data collection. With the rise of solutions based on information and communication technologies (ICT), the number of clinical studies using such technologies increases. Thus, the need to support collaboration during earlier project phases increases as data collection has to be monitored remotely. We developed a VRE to provide support during all phases of ICT based studies. During a study on agitated behaviour of people with dementia based on ICT solutions, we employed this VRE.

10.1002/cpe.3524,Reflections on science gateways sustainability through the business model canvas: Case study of a neuroscience gateway,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,2015,Article,"The sustainability of science gateways has been a topic of active discussion because they have been created and supported in the context of temporary research and infrastructure projects. As successful projects come to an end, it is necessary to find (new) models to secure continuous exploitation of products generated by these projects. Taking this step requires business considerations that are not trivial to do from the role of a researcher. This paper presents our experiences in adopting a methodology from lean business development, the Business Model Canvas (BMC). This methodology enables structured reflection upon the business model and facilitates exploring alternative ones (pivoting). We have applied the BMC to one of the science gateways designed, developed, and operated by the Academic Medical Center (AMC) e-Science group: the AMC Computational Neuroscience Gateway. The current gateway BMC is explained in the paper and used as basis for a reflection to improve its sustainability. Alternative business models are given as examples of BMC iteration or pivots. This exercise helped us to structure the various aspects to be considered when designing or reflecting upon the business model of our gateway. It also facilitated the visualization of the complete business picture and helps the reflection about improvements in the business model toward sustainability. We believe that this methodology could be valuable also for the reflection about sustainability of other science gateways that are growing from academic groups that do not have business training. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Business Model Canvas (BMC), science gateways, sustainability, virtual research environments",1,0,1,2

The 2D “flattening” of photographs results in a significant loss of features especially if the photos were taken by one person. Automatically collecting and aligning photos in order to render 3D structures from 2D images without specialised equipment is currently a complex process that requires specialist knowledge with often limited results. In this paper, an Open Science oriented workflow is proposed where an on-line file system is used to share photos of an object or an environment and to produce a virtual reality scene as a navigable 3D reconstruction that can be shared with other people. Our workflow is based on a distributed e-Infrastructure and overcomes common limitations of other approaches by having all the used technology integrated on the same platform and by not requiring specialist knowledge. A performance evaluation of the 3D reconstruction process embedded in the workflow is reported against a commercial software and an open-source software in terms of computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, and three marine science use cases are reported to show potential applications of the workflow. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D reconstruction, cloud computing, e-infrastructures, open science, photogrammetry, photography, virtual reality, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Moreover, the interdisciplinary character of these challenges requires that a large diversity of different data sources and information is combined in new, innovative ways. There is a pressing need to support researchers with environments that allow them to efficiently work together and co-develop research. As research is often data-intensive, and big data becomes a common part of a lot of research, such environments should also offer the resources, tools and workflows that allow to process data at scale if needed.

The problem is that 3D models in online virtual research environments may tempt users to believe them as historical truth.

This paper explains – via use-case examples from the ancient Maya city of Copan, Honduras – a procedure for structuring heterogeneous data to enable interactive, web-based access to 3D reconstructions of cultural heritage. A prototype 3D WebGIS system was built that can store, manage, and visualize 3D models and integrates these with georeferenced archaeological data. An ontology was created, a segmentation pipeline was developed, and databases and services were designed to structure and integrate the data in the 3D WebGIS.

As a response to increased graphics performance in computing technologies and information visualization, Card et al. developed the Information Visualization Reference Model. Due to further developments in Information Systems as well as Data Analysis and Knowledge Management Systems in recent years, this reference model has to be adapted for addressing the recent advancements. Thus, the hybridly refined and extended IVIS4BigData Reference Model was derived from the original model to cover the new conditions of the present situation with advanced visual interfaces providing opportunities for perceiving, managing, and interpreting Big Data analysis results to support insight and emerging knowledge generation. After deriving the IVIS4BigData Model, the necessity to evaluate the appropriateness of this reference model existed. In this context, a full day workshop on Road Mapping Infrastructures for Advanced Visual Interfaces Supporting Big Data Applications in Virtual Research Environments was proposed and conducted at the Advanced Visual Interfaces conference 2016. This focused event for virtual research environment and human computer interaction research experts was utilized to present, discuss, and evaluate the derived IVIS4BigData reference model. In order to validate some of the properties of the derived model in a kind of pre-testing evaluation, all of these experts were asked to take part in a questionnaire before the start of the workshop and the corresponding results are outlined within this paper. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Advanced visual user interfaces, distributed big data analysis, Information visualization, IVIS4BigData, User empowerment, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Supporting Big Data Applications,2016,Conference Paper,"There are many systems that visualize abstract data in the context of Information Visualization (IVIS). However, most systems create unidirectional visualizations that represent a static product of the source data. Possible changes to the content of the visualization-if that is possible at all-are not reflected to the data sources. This paper recommends a theoretical approach to use modern Web technologies and state-of-the-art system architectures to conceptualize a synchronization-enabled Web-based 3D IVIS infrastructure. Within applications built on top of this infrastructure, clients are able to modify data properties within three-dimensional real-time visualizations. In consequence, these content modifications are automatically transmitted to the server-side data sources for persistence. Moreover, relevant content changes on the server side are broadcast to all registered clients to maintain a permanent consistent state between data sources and derived IVIS-products. Particularly, a Mediator-Wrapper architecture is used in order to semantically integrate heterogeneous data sources in Big Data scenarios. Note that this paper presents a theoretical approach and that validation and evaluation are future tasks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","3D information visualization, big data, Mediator-Wrapper architecture, Synchronization-enabled IVIS infrastructure",0,0,1,1

Supporting Big Data Applications,2016,Conference Paper,"Virtual Research Environments (VREs) are distributed and dynamic software environments that foster the collaboration of people from different disciplines by supporting the accomplishment of complex research tasks. VREs lack efficient and effective user interfaces able to satisfy the needs of the different types of people collaborating in performing certain tasks. Thus, a great challenge that VREs have to address is user diversity, which arises from different factors such as cultural background of users, their reasoning strategies, the way they carry out their tasks in their daily practices, and the languages and notations they are familiar with. This paper provides a solution to this challenge by proposing to create VREs that exploit the meta-design approach we have developed to design interactive systems that address user diversity. We then describe a mashup platform, built according to the meta-design approach, which supports non-technical users in accessing and manipulating information in VREs by enabling them to extract contents from heterogeneous sources and manipulate such content in their personal interactive environments, thus creating new content that can be shared among people collaborating to a task in a VRE. Finally, it is briefly discussed how this platform can be useful in some phases of the recently proposed model of Information Visualization for Big Data. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","data integration, Data visualization, Mashups, Web composition environments",0,0,1,1

However, users face difficulties while they perform complex operations via cyberinfrastructures by using their user interfaces (UIs), for big data analysis and research. Using these infrastructures users perform operations such as data access, data visualization to complete their research activities. Unfortunately, there are not enough studies and projects conducted so far that provides guidelines to developers to design and develop interfaces that meet user requirements in cyberinfrastructures. These infrastructures are also known as e-infrastructures, big data infrastructures, open data infrastructures, virtual research environments. In this work, guidelines are recommended so that user requirements can directly be incorporated into the design and development of cyberinfrastructure applications serving a particular target audience. In this paper, an example of a cyberinfrastructure is given, using which users can be involved in its design and the development. These techniques can then also be transferred to the designers and developers of other cyberinfrastructures to improve the user experience as well as usability of UIs and associated services. Furthermore, these techniques can be enhanced even further and generalized to meet the requirements of users of applications other than cyberinfrastructures. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Big data infrastructures, citizen science, Cyberinfrastructure (CI), e-infrastructures, e-research, e-science, Human computer interaction (HCI), open data, usability, User experience (UX)",0,0,1,1

Such resources are often used for clinical matchmaking and allow information on patients and patient disorders to be shared by clinicians with wider biomedical research communities outside of a given hospital setting, and potentially with patients and/or patient advisory groups. Whilst addressing aspects of clinical collaborations through making targeted biomedical data accessible - such registries are really only a starting point for what can be achieved to support research collaborations. In particular, registries should ideally be augmented with a portfolio of additional service offerings that facilitate secure research collaborations: bio-banking and bio-sample data tracking capabilities; support for feasibility analysis on clinical trials and studies; offer seamless data transfer to/from clinical trials; provide search and analytical capabilities in a user-driven research environment.

According to GEO (Group on Earth Observation) vision, Geohazard Supersites provide access to spaceborne and in-situ geophysical data and models for selected sites prone to natural hazards –noticeably, earthquakes and volcano eruptions. The VRE was implemented in the framework of the Mediterranean Supersite Volcanoes (MED-SUV) project, funded by the European Commission. MED-SUV realized one of the European supersite demonstrators covering the two Permanent Supersites selected in Italy: Mt. Etna and Campi Flegrei/Vesuvius. The MED-SUV VRE provides advanced services for heterogeneous data and information management and sharing.

MED-SUV adopted a System of Systems (SoS) approach to address interoperability with the identified heterogeneous systems supplying data and information. The SoS approach is based on a brokering architecture, where a specialized component (i.e the MED-SUV Broker: MSB) connects the existing and next-coming data sources leaving them autonomous. MSB carries out all the necessary mediation and harmonization tasks exposing standard interfaces enabling the interconnection with external systems like GEOSS and EPOS.

One such collaborative effort was evaluated over a period of four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in biomedical laboratories. Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system.

10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107623,Global Food-source Identifier (GFI): Collaborative virtual research environment and shared data catalogue for the foodborne outbreak investigation international community,Food Control,2021,Article,"The source of a foodborne disease outbreak (FBO) is often difficult to identify, especially in the early phase where interventions would be most efficient. In addition, data on FBOs are mostly scattered in different formats either in national databases and reports or within pathogen-specific or regional reporting networks, both of which are often only accessible to a selected number of individuals. Here, we developed an international, open, shared and searchable data catalogue of past FBOs – the Global Food-source Identifier (GFI). GFI was developed with two objectives: a) to create a collaborative online community of FBO investigators, encouraging the international sharing of data in a harmonized, detailed and comparable manner and b) to support foodborne outbreak investigation worldwide by providing access to detailed records of past outbreaks, which can convey valuable insight into potential ‘risk foods’ of a detected pathogen. GFI is hosted within a Virtual Research Environment (VRE), which offers additional features to facilitate the collaboration between the outbreak investigators. These features allow document exchange, communication and data visualization and analysis between the VRE members. Based on scientific literature on foodborne outbreaks and discussions within a working group, we selected a total of 46 attributes characterising the outbreak records to be included in the catalogue, aggregated under the four overarching categories causative agent, epidata, food source and report details. Detailed descriptions of the attributes in the catalogue and instructions for harmonized data reporting are available on a wiki page in the VRE. At the time of writing and public launch of GFI, the data catalogue was populated with records of 102 FBOs occurred in Denmark over a period of 12 years (2005–2016) and covering the most frequent pathogens and a broad range of typing methods. The VRE features that enable data analysis, document sharing and communication between members were applied for the graphical representation of the records available in GFI, and for the sharing of results and script files within the VRE. The descriptive analysis included the relationship between the most frequent causative agents and outbreak food sources. Such results can support a risk-based food sampling strategy in the very beginning of a foodborne outbreak investigation. The Global Food-source Identifier is a data catalogue specifically designed to host an international collection of FBO records reported in a detailed and harmonized manner. It is implemented in a virtual research environment that offers key features to facilitate and enhance the global collaboration and data sharing among FBO investigators. Once in active use by the international food safety community, we envisage that GFI will contribute to the success of FBO investigations worldwide. © 2020 The Authors","data sharing, Food source, Foodborne outbreak investigation, Harmonization, Microbial typing, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Publication possibilities for LiDAR datasets, however, are limited due to the large size and often proprietary nature of the data. Fortunately, web-based, geographic information systems (WebGIS) that can securely manage temporal and spatial data hold great promise as virtual research environments for working with and publishing LiDAR data. To test this and to obtain new data for archaeological research, in 2013, the MayaArch3D Project (www.mayaarch3d.org) collected LiDAR data for the archaeological site of Copan, Honduras. Results include: 1) more accurate archaeological maps, 2) identification of unrecorded archaeological features, 3) an assessment of combining LiDAR and ground-checking to increase data accuracy in ecologically and topographically diverse landscapes, and 4) new LiDAR datasets that are hosted in a 3D WebGIS and integrated with other archaeological data to enhance data accessibility and collaborative research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","3D WebGIS, Copan, data integration, Landscape Archaeology, LiDAR, Maya archaeology, Settlement patterns",0,0,1,1

This is especially the case when dealing with rare diseases where a lack of data, information and/or sharing of expertise can cause delays in progressing the understanding and potential diagnosis/treatment of such diseases. Research into adrenal tumours is one such area where co-ordination of international cancer efforts is essential. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours - Structuring clinical research on adrenal cancers in adults (ENS@T-CANCER) project has recently been funded by the European Union to establish a state of the art Virtual Research Environment (VRE) supporting all aspects of international research and collaboration into the aetiology, diagnosis and establishing optimal treatment strategies for patients with adrenal cancer. It is envisaged that this VRE will comprise a portfolio of clinical databases for the different types of adrenal tumours that exist; support and integrate a seamless federation of adrenal tumour bio-banks with support for bio-sample tracking; support a wide range of -omics research into adrenal tumours and allow results to be shared amongst collaborators; offer advanced visualization services, and support several large-scale clinical trials comprising cohorts of patients with different kinds/treatments of adrenal tumours. This paper outlines the goals of the ENS@T-CANCER project and outlines the on-going implementation work. We show how security-oriented information can be collected and tracked through the VRE including supporting collection of clinical data sets and their linkage with associated bio-samples in an ethically-driven framework. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adrenal tumours, Biobanks, Ethics, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

The workflow environments seem best suited for their needs, but in practice they proved to be too complicated for most users. Before such environments are used commonly, they have to be properly adapted for specific needs of the scientific domain. To that end, we have created a universal solution based on the Kepler workflow environment. It consists of a library of domain modules, ready-to-use workflows and additional services for sharing and running workflows. There are three access levels depending on the needs and skills of the user: 1) desktop application, 2) web application 3) on-demand Virtual Research Environment. The whole solution is set up in the context of Polish Grid Infrastructure, enabling access to its resources. For flexibility it includes interoperability mechanisms with the domain specific applications and services (including astronomical Virtual Observatory) as well as with other domain grid services. © The Authors.

This kind of execution is one of the requirements for Integrated Tokamak Modelling platform developed by the Nuclear Fusion community within the context of EUROFusion project [2]. The platform is unique and original: it entails the development of a comprehensive and completely generic tokamak simulator including both the physics and the machine, which can be applied for any fusion device. All components are linked inside work ows. This approach allows complex coupling of various algorithms while at the same time provides consistency. Work ows are composed of Kepler and Ptolemy II elements as well as set of the native libraries written in various languages (Fortran, C, C++). In addition to that, there are Python based components that are used for visualization of results as well as for pre/post processing. At the bottom of all these components there is a database layer that may vary between software releases, and require di erent version of access libraries. The community is using shared virtual research environment to prepare and execute work ows. All these constraints make running multiple Kepler sessions really challenging. However, ability to run numerous sessions in parallel is a must - to reduce computation time and to make it possible to run released codes while working with new software at the same time.

From international to local scales, environmental policies and indicators are increasingly percolating down from the global to the local agendas. The scientific business processes for the generation of EVs and related indicators can be formalized in workflows specifying the necessary logical steps. To this aim, GEOEssential is developing a Virtual Laboratory the main objective of which is to instantiate conceptual workflows, which are stored in a dedicated knowledge base, generating executable workflows.

The nodes are interconnected by a local network or the Internet and exchange data and control instructions via SSH connections and web services. Geospatial data is represented by collections of netCDF files stored in a hierarchy of directories in the framework of a file system.

IT-expertise requirements on the user side are kept to a minimum, and workflows can be re-used effortlessly by any novice user. We validate our method in the field of metabolomics on two mass spectrometry, one nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and one fluxomics study. We showed that the method scales dynamically with increasing availability of computational resources. We demonstrated that the method facilitates interoperability using integration of the major software suites resulting in a turn-key workflow encompassing all steps for massspectrometry- based metabolomics including preprocessing, statistics and identification.

Design/methodology/approach: Usability testing was used to evaluate the usability of OJAX++ in relation to biology researchers. Interviews with biology researchers in a large Irish university were conducted to investigate their research information behaviour, to establish user requirements in their discipline and to evaluate the feasibility of using OJAX++ in their research. Findings: The results show that biology researchers used online tools extensively in their research but do not use social networking tools. E-mail and phone conversations are the preferred methods of collaborating with colleagues. The biology researchers found that OJAX++ was easy to use, intuitive and professionally presented but in its present format, OJAX++ does not fit in with current research practices as they do not use Web 2.0 tools that facilitate tagging. A list of requirements of a VRE for biology researchers is presented. Originality/value: The findings of the study will assist developers of VREs and other web tools to better understand how researchers, in particular biologists, collaborate during the research process and what they require from online research tools.

Design/methodology/approach: The research design of this article consists of empirical and non-empirical research. The non-empirical part consists of a critical literature review to synthesise the strengths, weaknesses (limitations) and omissions of identified VRE models as found in literature to develop a conceptual VRE model. As part of the critical literature review concepts were clarified and possible applications of VREs in research lifecycles and research data lifecycles were explored. The empirical part focused on the practical application of this model. This part of the article follows an interpretivist paradigm, and a qualitative research approach, using case studies as inquiry method. Case studies with a positivist perspective were selected through purposive sampling, and inferences were drawn from the sample to design and test a conceptual VRE model, and to investigate the management of research data through a VRE. Investigation was done through a process of participatory action research (PAR) and included semi-structured interviews and participant observation data collection techniques. Evaluation of findings was done through formative and summative evaluation. Findings: The article presents a VRE conceptual model, with identified generic component layers and components that could potentially be applied and used in different research settings/disciplines. The article also reveals the role that VREs play in the successful management of research data throughout the research lifecycle. Guidelines for setting up a conceptual VRE model are offered. Practical implications: This article assisted in clarifying and validating the various components of a conceptual VRE model that could be used in different research settings and disciplines for research data management. Originality/value: This article confirms/validates generic layers and components that would be needed in a VRE by synthesising these in a conceptual model in the context of a research lifecycle and presents guidelines for setting up a conceptual VRE model. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","components, Conceptual model, Research data management, South Africa, virtual research environments, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Such resources include dictionaries, thesauri, corpora, images, audio and video collections. These resources are typically distributed, and comprise non-interoperable repositories of data that are often license protected. In this context, researchers conduct their research through direct access to individual resources. This form of research is non-scalable, time consuming and often frustrating to the researchers. The JISC funded project Enhancing Repositories for Language and Literature Researchers (ENROLLER, http://www.gla.ac.uk/enroller/) aims to address by provision of an interactive, research infrastructure providing seamless access to major language and literature repositories. This paper describes this infrastructure and the services that have been developed to overcome the issues in access and use of digital resources in humanities. In particular, we describe how high performance computing facilities including the UK e-Science National Grid Service (NGS, http://www.ngs.ac.uk) have been exploited to support advanced, bulk search capabilities, implemented using Google's MapReduce algorithm. We also describe our experiences in the use of the resource brokering Workload Management System (WMS) and the Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS) solutions in this space.

More often than not, research takes place outside of a healthcare setting. However access to and use of clinical data for research purposes has many challenges that must be overcome, not least of which are the lack of standardized nomenclature and the heterogeneity of healthcare IT systems. For rare conditions, this challenge is particularly acute since the scarcity of data makes scientific breakthroughs increasingly difficult. Adrenal tumours represent one rare disease area where consolidation of clinical and biological information is urgently required. This paper describes the lessons being learnt in the development and rollout of an advanced security-oriented, virtual research environment (VRE) as part of the EU funded ENS@T-CANCER project. This system is currently used by 39 major cancer research centres across Europe and provides a unique resource for adrenal cancer research, underpinning an expanding portfolio of major international clinical trials and studies.

This paper argues that VREs in combination with Semantic Web technologies offer a range of possibilities to align research with library practices. This main claim of the article is exemplified by a metadata integration process of bibliographic data from libraries to a VRE which is based on Semantic MediaWiki. The integration process rests on three pillars: MediaWiki as a web-based repository, Semantic MediaWiki annotation mechanisms, and semi-automatic workflow management for the integration of digital resources. Thereby, needs of scholarly research practices and capacities for interactions are taken into account. The integration process is part of the design of Semantic MediaWiki for Collaborative Corpora Analysis (SMW-CorA) which uses a concrete research project in the history of education as a reference point for an infrastructural distribution.

The main challenge is capturing the multi-layered and iterative research process by participatory and evolutionary design using an agile framework development. The paper focuses on the development of a VRE to enhance scholarly research practices with the specific goal to enable dialogic transcript data analysis in Social Sciences and Humanities, using digital and semantic technologies. To offer a user-friendly framework with a low technological barrier, the authors used existing SMW extensions and developed a novel extension for multi-layered dialogic analysis by adopting the researcher's theoretical model of Objective Hermeneutic. As use case of addressing dialogic qualitative data analysis, the paper presents the VRE for classroom interaction which is based on two ontological models, the Objective Hermeneutic core ontology and the classroom interaction ontology, as a result of authors' work. © 2017 ACM.","Conversation Analysis, Dialogical Theories, humanities, Objective Hermeneutic, Open Collaboration Research, Qualitative Data Analysis, semantic MediaWiki, semantic web, Social Sciences, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Effective research into understanding the aetiology, as well as long-term outcome of these rare conditions, requires multicentre collaboration often across national boundaries. The EU-funded EuroDSD programme (www.eurodsd.eu) is one such collaboration involving clinical centres and clinical and genetic experts across Europe. At the heart of the EuroDSD collaboration is a European DSD registry and a targeted virtual research environment (VRE) that supports the sharing of DSD data. Security, ethics and information governance are cornerstones of this infrastructure.

10.1186/1758-2946-3-45,Ami - The chemist's amanuensis,Journal of Cheminformatics,2011,Article,"The Ami project was a six month Rapid Innovation project sponsored by JISC to explore the Virtual Research Environment space. The project brainstormed with chemists and decided to investigate ways to facilitate monitoring and collection of experimental data. A frequently encountered use-case was identified of how the chemist reaches the end of an experiment, but finds an unexpected result. The ability to replay events can significantly help make sense of how things progressed. The project therefore concentrated on collecting a variety of dimensions of ancillary data - data that would not normally be collected due to practicality constraints. There were three main areas of investigation: 1) Development of a monitoring tool using infrared and ultrasonic sensors; 2) Time-lapse motion video capture (for example, videoing 5 seconds in every 60); and 3) Activity-driven video monitoring of the fume cupboard environs. The Ami client application was developed to control these separate logging functions. The application builds up a timeline of the events in the experiment and around the fume cupboard. The videos and data logs can then be reviewed after the experiment in order to help the chemist determine the exact timings and conditions used. The project experimented with ways in which a Microsoft Kinect could be used in a laboratory setting. Investigations suggest that it would not be an ideal device for controlling a mouse, but it shows promise for usages such as manipulating virtual molecules. © 2011 Brooks et al; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.","speech recognition, Video Capture, Fume Cupboard, Speech Recognition Package, Java Medium Framework",0,0,1,1

The oncoming climate changes will exert influence on the ecosystems, on the all branches of the international economy, and on the quality of life. Regional climate models (RCMs) are important instruments used for downscaling climate simulations from Global circulation models (GCMs). The air quality (AQ) impact on human health and quality of life is an issue of great social significance. Evaluating this impact will give scientifically robust basis for elaborating efficient short term measures and long term strategies for mitigation of the harmful effects of air pollution. The AQ impact is evaluated in the terms of Air Quality Indices (AQI). Some extensive numerical simulations of the atmospheric composition fields in Bulgaria and Sofia have been recently performed. A quite extensive data base was created from simulations which were used for different studies of the atmospheric composition, including the AQ climate. Main aims of the numerical experiment presented in this paper are: (1) Adaptation and tuning of the RegCM model for the Balkan Peninsula and Bulgaria and thus development of a methodology able to predict possible changes of the regional climate for different global climate change scenarios and their impact on spatial/temporal distribution of precipitation, hence the global water budgets, to changes of the characteristics and spatial/temporal distribution of extreme, unfavorable and catastrophic events (drought, storms, hail, floods, fires, sea waves, soil erosion, etc.). (2) Development of a methodology and performing reliable, comprehensive and detailed studies of the impact of lower atmosphere parameters and characteristics on the quality of life (QL) and health risks (HR) for the population. © 2018 SCPE.","Air Quality Indices, RegCM, Regional climate models, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1

Virtual reconstruction and 3D visualization have revealed a new “glittering” research space for object-oriented disciplines such as archaeology, art history and architecture. Nevertheless, the scientists concerned with the new technology soon recognized the lack of documentation standards in the 3D projects, leading to the loss of information, findings and the fusion of knowledge behind the digital 3D representation. Based on the methodological fundamentals of digital 3D reconstruction, the potentials and challenges in the light of emerging Semantic Web and Web3D technologies is introduced here. The presentation describes a scientific methodology and a collaborative web-based research environment followed by crucial features for these kinds of projects. As the groundwork, a human- and machine-readable “language of objects” and the implementation of these semantic patterns for spatial research purposes on destroyed and/or never realized tangible cultural heritage will be discussed. Using examples from the practice, the presentation explains the requirements of the Semantic Web (Linked Data), the role of controlled vocabularies, the architecture of the VRE and the impact of a customized integration of interactive 3D models within WebGL technology. The presentation intends to showcase the state-of-the-art steps on the way to a digital research infrastructure.

However, these sensitive areas are under increasing pressures that significantly threaten their future sustainability. To help better manage tropical regions, a need exists for more informed environmental monitoring procedures. Currently, data is collected in disjoint repositories that are not visible or accessible for reuse. As data is not being publicised, there are missed opportunities for the holistic discovery of trends that influence tropical ecosystems. This paper presents the Tropical Data Hub as an e-research infrastructure to congregate significant tropical data sets for cross-domain analyses and knowledge discovery. The Hub serves as a focal point for the amalgamation of disparate data sources to facilitate data reuse, integration, searching, and correlation by environmental researchers and government departments for discovery and decision making. More suitable environmental management practices may then be devised via cross-disciplinary data that depicts a more accurate representation of the status. The system automates the data capture process and incorporates semantic technologies to provide knowledge discovery. We present two successful visualisation applications that demonstrate the Hub's capacity to enhance tropical environmental research. The first assesses land space use, and the second assesses potential impacts of climate change on global biodiversity. © Common Ground, Trina Myers, Jarrod Trevathan, Ian Atkinson, All Rights Reserved.","Environmental monitoring, knowledge discovery, Semantic technologies, Tropical biodiversity, virtual research environments",0,0,1,1
10.2196/13993,Development and evaluation of a virtual research environment to improve quality of care in overcrowded emergency departments: Observational study,JMIR Serious Games,2019,Article,"Background: Despite a wide range of literature on emergency department (ED) overcrowding, scientific knowledge on emergency physicians' cognitive processes coping with overcrowding is limited. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a virtual research environment that will allow us to study the effect of physicians' strategies and behaviors on quality of care in the context of ED overcrowding. Methods: A simulation-based observational study was conducted over two stages: The development of a simulation model and its evaluation. A research environment in emergency medicine combining virtual reality and simulated patients was designed and developed. Afterwards, 12 emergency physicians took part in simulation scenarios and had to manage 13 patients during a 2-hour period. The study outcome was the authenticity of the environment through realism, consistency, and mastering. The realism was the resemblance perceived by the participants between virtual and real ED. The consistency of the scenario and the participants' mastering of the environment was expected for 90% (12/13) of the participants. Results: The virtual ED was considered realistic with no significant difference from the real world with respect to facilities and resources, except for the length of time of procedures that was perceived to be shorter. A total of 100% (13/13) of participants deemed that patient information, decision making, and managing patient flow were similar to real clinical practice. The virtual environment was well-mastered by all participants over the course of the scenarios. Conclusions: The new simulation tool, Virtual Research Environment in Emergency Medicine, has been successfully designed and developed. It has been assessed as perfectly authentic by emergency physicians compared with real EDs and thus offers another way to study human factors, quality of care, and patient safety in the context of ED overcrowding. © 2019 JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies.

10.22323/1.293.0015,Data Provenance Tracking as the Basis for a Biomedical Virtual Research Environment,International Symposium on Grids and Clouds,2017,Conference Paper,"In complex data analyses it is increasingly important to capture information about the usage of data sets in addition to their preservation over time to ensure reproducibility of results, to verify the work of others and to ensure appropriate conditions data have been used for specific analyses. Scientific workflow based studies are beginning to realize the benefit of capturing this provenance of data and the activities used to process, transform and carry out studies on those data. This is especially true in biomedicine where the collection of data through experiment is costly and/or difficult to reproduce and where that data needs to be preserved over time. One way to support the development of workflows and their use in (collaborative) biomedical analyses is through the use of a Virtual Research Environment. The dynamic and distributed nature of Grid/Cloud computing, however, makes the capture and processing of provenance information a major research challenge. Furthermore most workflow provenance management services are designed only for data-flow oriented workflows and researchers are now realising that tracking data or workflows alone or separately is insufficient to support the scientific process. What is required for collaborative research is traceable and reproducible provenance support in a full orchestrated Virtual Research Environment (VRE) that enables researchers to define their studies in terms of the datasets and processes used, to monitor and visualize the outcome of their analyses and to log their results so that others users can call upon that acquired knowledge to support subsequent studies. We have extended the work carried out in the neuGRID and N4U projects in providing a so-called Virtual Laboratory to provide the foundation for a generic VRE in which sets of biomedical data (images, laboratory test results, patient records, epidemiological analyses etc.) and the workflows (pipelines) used to process those data, together with their provenance data and results sets are captured in the CRISTAL software. This paper outlines the functionality provided for a VRE by the Open Source CRISTAL software and examines how that can provide the foundations for a practice-based knowledge base for biomedicine and, potentially, for a wider research community.

The research profile of the DHLab integrates computer science, digital imaging, computational photography, the accessibility of digital objects and solutions for digital preservation with the aim to support scholars in the emerging field of humanities research. The project Digital Materiality, a collaboration with the Seminar of Art History, examines how new imaging and visualization methods can be applied to describe the reflection of light on surfaces of artworks. Of main interest are mosaics and early prints; both types of artworks have a strong interaction with light that can not captured adequately by standard photographic approaches. Conventional photographic processes are not able to capture the dynamic component of the light-surface interdependence that is specific for this kind of art. The technical part of the project focuses on improving the methodology that is in general described as Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) techniques. RTI is an approach based on a mathematical model, that is fitted in image data derived from photographs. By modifying the mathematical model that is used to represent the light-surface interaction, the digital reproduction can be improved so that relevant attributes of artworks can be transported into the digital domain in such a way that the requirements and needs of humanities researchers to a digital representation can be fulfilled. The improvements take into account more sophisticated but still robust and simple reflection models for the realistic visualization of localized diffuse and specular surfaces within the same digital reproduction.

This complicates research on multidisciplinary societal challenges. The objective of this paper is to present a reference architecture and components that can be (re)used to construct a general, domain-specific or cross-domain enhanced VRE (e-VRE) that enhances FAIR-ness of data and process interoperability across research infrastructures. The e-VRE makes it easier to conduct multidisciplinary research by assisting the researcher in accessing and utilising the assets of research, commonly stored in digital Research Infrastructures. The reference architecture also reduces complexity by interfacing with research management systems. © 2019 IADIS Press.

The cyberhubs system is an easy-to-deploy package for small-to medium-sized collaborations based on the Jupyter and Docker technology, which allows web-browser-enabled, remote, interactive analytic access to shared data. It offers an initial step to address these challenges. The features and deployment steps of the system are described, as well as the requirements collection through an account of the different approaches to data structuring, handling, and available analytic tools for the NuGrid and PPMstar collaborations. NuGrid is an international collaboration that creates stellar evolution and explosion physics and nucleosynthesis simulation data. The PPMstar collaboration performs large-scale 3D stellar hydrodynamics simulations of interior convection in the late phases of stellar evolution. Examples of science that is currently performed on cyberhubs, in the areas of 3D stellar hydrodynamic simulations, stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, and Galactic chemical evolution, are presented. © 2018.

10.3897/BDJ.1.e973,EXIF Custom: Automatic image metadata extraction for Scratchpads and Drupal,Biodiversity Data Journal,2013,Article,"Many institutions and individuals use embedded metadata to aid in the management of their image collections. Many deskop image management solutions such as Adobe Bridge and online tools such as Flickr also make use of embedded metadata to describe, categorise and license images. Until now Scratchpads (a data management system and virtual research environment for biodiversity) have not made use of these metadata, and users have had to manually re-enter this information if they have wanted to display it on their Scratchpad site. The Drupal described here allows users to map metadata embedded in their images to the associated field in the Scratchpads image form using one or more customised mappings. The module works seamlessly with the bulk image uploader used on Scratchpads and it is therefore possible to upload hundreds of images easily with automatic metadata (EXIF, XMP and IPTC) extraction and mapping. © Baker E.","Drupal, EXIF, Image metadata, IPTC, Scratchpads, XMP",0,0,1,1
10.3897/BDJ.4.e7965,"Capturing biodiversity: Linking a cyanobacteria culture collection to the ""scratchpads"" virtual research environment enhances biodiversity knowledge",Biodiversity Data Journal,2016,Article,"Background Currently, cyanobacterial diversity is examined using a polyphasic approach by assessing morphological and molecular data (Komárek 2015). However, the comparison of morphological and genetic data is sometimes hindered by the lack of cultures of several cyanobacterial morphospecies and inadequate morphological data of sequenced strains (Rajaniemi et al. 2005). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity within defined taxa, the variability observed in cultures has to be compared to the range in natural variation (Komárek and Mareš 2012). Thus, new tools are needed to aggregate, link and process data in a meaningful way, in order to properly study and understand cyanodiversity. New information An online database on cyanobacteria has been created, namely the Cyanobacteria culture collection (CCC) ( http://cyanobacteria.myspecies.info/) using as case studies cyanobacterial strains isolated from lakes of Greece, which are part of the AUTH culture collection (School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki). The database hosts, for the first time, information and data such as morphology/morphometry, biogeography, phylogeny, microphotographs, distribution maps, toxicology and biochemical traits of the strains. All this data are structured managed, and presented online and are publicly accessible with a recently developed tool, namely ""Scratchpads"", a taxon-centric virtual research environment allowing browsing the taxonomic classification and retrieving various kinds of relevant information for each taxon. © Gkelis S, Panou M.","Biodiversity informatics, Cyanobacteria, databases, Morphology, Phylogeny, Scratchpads, taxonomy",0,0,1,1
10.3897/BDJ.4.e9434,"LifeWatchGreece Portal development: Architecture, implementation and challenges for a biodiversity research e-infrastructure",Biodiversity Data Journal,2016,Article,"Background Biodiversity data is characterized by its cross-disciplinary character, the extremely broad range of data types and structures, and the plethora of different data sources providing resources for the same piece of information in a heterogeneous way. Since the web inception two decades ago, there are multiple initiatives to connect, aggregate, share, and publish biodiversity data, and to establish data and work flows in order to analyze them. The European program LifeWatch aims at establishing a distributed network of nodes implementing virtual research environment in Europe to facilitate the work of biodiversity researchers and managers. LifeWatchGreece is one of these nodes where a portal was developed offering access to a suite of virtual laboratories and e-services. New information Despite its strict definition in information technology, in practice ""portal"" is a fairly broad term that embraces many web architectures. In the biodiversity domain, the term ""portal"" is usually used to indicate either a web site that provides access to a single or an aggregation of data repositories (like: http://indiabiodiversity.org/, http://www.mountainbiodiversity.org/, http://data.freshwaterbiodiversity.eu), a web site that gathers information about various online biodiversity tools (like http://test-eubon.ebd.csic.es/, http://marine.lifewatch.eu/) or a web site that just gathers information and news about the biodiversity domain (like http:// chm.moew.government.bg). LifeWatchGreece's portal takes the concept of a portal a step further. In strict IT terms, LifeWatchGreece's portal is partly a portal, partly a platform and partly an aggregator. It includes a number of biodiversity-related web tools integrated into a centrally-controlled software ecosystem. This ecosystem includes subsystems for access control, traffic monitoring, user notifications and web tool management. These subsystems are shared to all the web tools that have been integrated to the portal and thereby are part of this ecosystem. These web tools do not consist in external and completely independent web applications as it happens in most other portals. A quite obvious (to the user) indication of this is the Single-Sign-On (SSO) functionality for all tools and the common user interface wrapper that most of these tools use. Another example of a less obvious functionality is the common user profile that is shared and can be utilized by all tools (e.g user's timezone). © Gougousis A, Bailly N.","Biodiversity Information System, E-service, Research e-Infrastructure, Virtual Laboratories (vLab), virtual research environments",0,1,1,2
10.4018/IJEGR.2017100105,Analysing Open Data in Virtual Research Environments: New Collaboration Opportunities to Improve Policy Making,International Journal of Electronic Government Research,2017,Article,"This article describes how virtual research environments (VREs) offer new opportunities for researchers to analyse open data and to obtain new insights for policy making. Although various VRE-related initiatives are under development, there is a lack of insight into how VREs support collaborative open data analysis by researchers and how this might be improved, ultimately leading to input for policy making to solve societal issues. This article clarifies in which ways VREs support researchers in open data analysis. Seven cases presenting different modes of researcher support for open data analysis were investigated and compared. Four types of support were identified: 1) ‘Figure it out yourself’, 2) ‘Leading users by the hand’, 3) ‘Training to provide the basics’ and 4) ‘Learning from peers’. The author provides recommendations to improve the support of researchers’ open data analysis and to subsequently obtain new insights for policy making to solve societal challenges.","collaboration, OGD, open data, Open Government Data, Use, User Support, virtual research environments, VREs",0,0,1,1

Numerous interventions are concentrated in the digitalisation of library collections, but also commercial companies like Microsoft or Google try to convert large analogue stocks such as books, paintings, etc. in digital form. Data in digital form can be much easier made accessible to a large user community, especially to the interested scientific community. <br><br> The aim of the described research project is to set up a virtual research environment for interdisciplinary research focusing on the landscape of the historical Mecklenburg in the north-east of Germany. Georeferenced old maps from 1786 and 1890 covering complete Mecklenburg should be combined with current geo-information, satellite and aerial imagery to support spatio-temporal research aspects in different scales in space (regional 1:200,000 to local 1:25.000) and time (nearly 250 years in three time steps, the last 30 years also in three time slices). <br><br> The Virtual Laboratory for Cultural Landscape Research (VKLandLab) is designed and developed by the Chair of Geodesy and Geoinformatics, hosted at the Computing Centre (ITMZ) and linked to the Digital Library (UB) at Rostock University. VKLandLab includes new developments such as wikis, blogs, data tagging, etc. and proven components already integrated in various data-related infrastructures such as InternetGIS, data repositories and authentication structures. The focus is to build a data-related infrastructure and a work platform that supports students as well as researchers from different disciplines in their research in space and time.","cultural landscapes, data infrastructure, interoperability, Spatial Information science, web-based",0,1,1,2

10.1038/npre.2011.6066.1,Collaborative platforms for streamlining workflows in Open Science,Nature Precedings,2011,Article,"Despite the internet’s dynamic and collaborative nature, scientists continue to produce grant proposals, lab notebooks, data files, conclusions etc. that stay in static formats or are not published online and therefore not always easily accessible to the interested public. Because of limited adoption of tools that seamlessly integrate all aspects of a research project (conception, data generation, data evaluation, peer-reviewing and publishing of conclusions), much effort is later spent on reproducing or reformatting individual entities before they can be repurposed independently or as parts of articles.We propose that workflows - performed both individually and collaboratively - could potentially become more efficient if all steps of the research cycle were coherently represented online and the underlying data were formatted, annotated and licensed for reuse. Such a system would accelerate the process of taking projects from conception to publication stages and allow for continuous updating of the data sets and their interpretation as well as their integration into other independent projects.A major advantage of such workflows is the increased transparency, both with respect to the scientific process as to the contribution of each participant. The latter point is important from a perspective of motivation, as it enables the allocation of reputation, which creates incentives for scientists to contribute to projects. Such workflow platforms offering possibilities to fine-tune the accessibility of their content could gradually pave the path from the current static mode of research presentation into a more coherent practice of open science.","virtual research environments, collaboratories, workflow platform, automation, transparency, reproducibitliy, reputation, funding, open science, Open Hardware",0,0,1,1
